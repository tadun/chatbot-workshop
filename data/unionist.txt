Seating of Black Students at the Congregational Church	The Unionist	Canterbury Female Academy; Religion; African-American Students	"<p><em>From the (Brooklyn) Unionist, August 29</em></p>
<p>
  The last Advertiser declares that the story of the exclusion of Miss
  Crandall’s scholars from the meeting house “is wholly false.” We expressed
  surprise at a declaration so unqualified, and whether we had not some cause to
  do so, we leave our readers to decide, after they have read the following
  correspondence and the statement subjoined to it.
</p>
<p>
  We say nothing of the feelings which must have dictated such a course, except
  that we envy not their possessor. We wish merely to put on&nbsp; record the
  simple fact, that Miss Crandall’s pupils cannot attend public worship on the
  sabbath, in the only church within three miles of Miss C’s residence, without
  being called in question for so doing,—nay more—that they are virtually
  excluded from that place of worship, though some of them it is said are
  members of the church which regularly assembles there for public worship. And
  this is a land professedly Christian, in a State which boasts of its
  benevolent efforts to diffuse the blessings of the gospel among the distant
  heathen.”

<p>
  When the committee visited you last February, stating their objections to your
  school, they understood from you, by your voluntary suggestion, that you
  should never desire, and never would put your coloured scholars into the
  meeting house — that you could have preaching at your own house, either black
  or white, and you also added, that the citizens of Canterbury need have no
  anxiety on that account, they might be assured, no such request would ever be
  made.
</p>
<p>
  It appears now, that you have departed from this voluntary declaration and put
  your colored scholars into pews ever occupied by the white females of the
  parish. We ask you to inform us soon, by whose license, you have thus taken
  possession of that part of the meeting house.&nbsp; Canterbury July 26th 1833

</p>
<p>TO SOLOMON PAYNE, ANDREW HARRIS, and ISAAC KNIGHT,</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Gentlemen—I received a letter from you on the 27
  <sup>th</sup>
  in which you asked me to inform you soon by whose licence I have taken
  possession of that part of the meeting house that was occupied by my colored
  scholars on the sabbath previous.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; I can inform you that the authority, whether lawful or unlawful,
  by which I permitted my family to enter the gallery of your church, was
  permission received from two of the Society’s committee, viz. Dr. Harris and
  Deacon Bacon.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; On Saturday the 6
  <sup>th</sup>
  of this month I sent a verbal request by Samuel L. Hough to the gentlemen whom
  I address, asking your permission to attend Divine worship with you on the
  sabbath. I asked Captain Hough to inform you that I would purchase seats
  sufficient for my scholars if agreeable to you, if not, any part or portion of
  the meeting house you might see fit for us to occupy, would be acceptable. Of
  this Mr. Hough said he informed you. Dr. Harris, in answer, said we might
  occupy the seat in the gallery appropriated to colored persons. Mr. Hough then
  remarked that the seat would not be sufficient for the scholars—Deacon Bacon
  then replied, that we might take the next pews until we had enough to be
  seated.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Truly I said to the Committee that visited me in February
  last—The scholars who come here shall not trouble you on the Sabbath, for we
  can have preaching, either by colored or white ministers in our own house. The
  committee made me no reply at the time if I am not mistaken, and I think I am
  not.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Upon mature consideration (as regular preaching here was not very
  readily obtained) I considered that I had done entirely wrong in depriving my
  scholars of the privilege of attending religious worship in this village.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; These are my reasons for asking the privilege of entering your
  church; and all the licence I have received is as given above.
</p>

  with respect,

<p>P. CRANDALL.</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Shortly after the above answer was sent by Miss Crandall to the
  foregoing communication, she received a verbal message, by Samuel L. Hough, Esq. from
  SOLOMON PAYNE, Esq. directing her not to go into the meeting house again with
  her pupils. For the truth of this last statement we rely upon the declaration
  of Samuel L. Hough, Esq.
</p>
"		Church attendance, and church membership, were valorized cultural norms. Church seating was institutionalized as a marker of white supremacy, with African-Americans most often being limited to seats in the balcony. In fact, this very issue had led to the walkout by Black leaders Richard Allen and Absalom Jones from St. George's Methodist Church in Philadelphia that launched the [northern Black independent chuch movement] (http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/pds/maai/community/text3/allenmethodism.pdf).  Therefore this particular battle in Canterbury carried great emotional and strategic weight. For those reading about this controversy in the press - including <em>The Unionist</em> - the idea of denying the students access to attending church created an informal litmus test: spiritual equality before God (favoring the students) or preserving caste privilege in the key social institution that was the Congregational Church in Connecticut.

Formation of the Plainfield Anti-Slavery Society	The Unionist	Abolitionist Organizing; Burleigh Family	"<p>
  “The Unionist of August 29, gives an account of a meeting in Plainfield, Ct.
  at which the <em>‘Anti-Slavery Society of Plainfield, and its vicinity,’</em>
  was organized. An address was delivered by Mr. Andrew Rockwell, and a
  constitution adopted. Forty three persons then became members of the Society.
  The following persons were then chosen officers.

"		This same news item appeared in <em>The Abolitionist</em>, 1, no. 10 (October 1833): 159.  Samuel L. Hough (1785-1865) was a prominent white man in Canterbury, working as an axe manufactorer. He had enrolled two daughters in the First Academy, and had helped Crandall with a loan toward the mortgage on the building. He appears to play both sides in these early documents; his presence in the Anti-Slavery Society here comes as something of a surprise. He has a [Find-a-Grave memorial with more information].

Vigilante Attack on Canterbury Female Academy	The Unionist	Canterbury Female Academy; Religion; African-American Students	"<p>BROOKLYN, Ct. October 3.</p>
<p>
  On the evening of Friday Sept. 20th while Miss Crandall and her pupils were
  assembled in the school room for the purpose of holding a religious meeting,
  Rev. Mr. Potter of Pawtucket, R. I. having accepted her invitation to preach
  to them, near the close of the services a clamorous rabble, without, assailed
  the house, a volley of rotten eggs and other missiles were thrown at the
  window, breaking the glass and lodging part of the filth on the curtain. The
  pupils, regardless of the assault, commenced singing the hymn which had just
  been read and went through without interruption.
</p>
<p>
  On Thursday last [Sept. 26th] Miss C. was again brought before Esquire Adams
  for examination on two separate complaints, one for instructing and the other
  for boarding and harbouring {sic} colored persons from abroad. She was bound
  over to the Supreme Court which commenced its session in the place on Tuesday
  the first inst.

Charles C. Burleigh in the <em>Genius of Temperance</em> May 1833	<em>Genius of Temperance, Philanthropist and People’s Advocate</em> 3:45 (1833:05:15)	Canterbury Female Academy; White Opposition	<p>THE CANTERBURY AFFAIR. – Some of the people of Canterbury are still exasperated about the school for colored misses, recently established by Miss Crandall. But very few of the 30 or 40 scholars who were expected to commence with the term, have as yet attended — owing, probably, to the “fanaticism” which seems to have taken hold on the minds of so many of the sober citizens of that portion of the “land of steady habits;” and which vents itself in vexatious attempts at legally coercing the scholars to leave the town, and the teacher to abandon the enterprise. We have been favored by a correspondent, with the following copy of a proceeding of a town-meeting on the subject, which we publish “for the benefit of whom it may concern”</p><p>“At a town meeting legally warned and held at Canterbury on the 1st day of April, 1833, Asahel Bacon Esq. Moderator—</p><p>Voted, that a petition of the town of Canterbury, to the next general assembly, be drawn up in suitable language, deprecating the evil consequences of bringing from other towns, and other states, people of color, for any purpose, and more especially for the purposes of disseminating the principles and doctrines opposed to the benevolent colonization system, praying said assembly to pass and enact such laws, as in their wisdom will prevent the evil; and that Andrew P. Judson, William Lester, Chester Lyon, Rufus Adams, Solomon Payne, Andrew T. Harris, Asahel Bacon, George S. White, Daniel Packer and Isaac Backus, be agents to do the same.</p><p>Voted, that said agents respectfully request the inhabitants of other towns to proffer similar petitions, for the same laudable object.</p><p>The foregoing is a true copy of Record:</p><p>Examined by</p><p>Andrew Judson <em>Town Clerk</em></p><p>Fine business, truly!—<em>Perhaps</em> those who have been so much in the habit of reading homilies on constitutional law, to the “hair-brained emancipationists,” might be instructed with a peep into that instrument which binds our states together, and there read for themselves, the rights of citizens going from one state to another—<em>“for any purpose,”</em>—or in its favor,—so that they conduct morally and peaceably. But what are the “evil consequences” which are so much to be <em>“deprecated,”</em> in the petitions to the legislature of that state? And how can a “petition” be “drawn up in <em>suitable language,”</em> which “deprecates the evil consequences of bringing” people of color into that town, <em>“for any purpose”</em>—whether to gain moral or literary instruction, cultivate land, vend merchandize, or “make notions”? Garrison is completely “out Garrisoned,” in “fanaticism” and “incendiary” movements,—by a body which <em>ought</em> to have been deliberative! But we do not believe a majority of the citizens of Canterbury favor such “wild schemes,” even though backed by the declaration of a professing Christian, “that before he would see the Green polluted by a negro school, he would oppose it to the shedding of blood!”		This editorial, published two months prior to <em>The Unionist</em> even being hatched, is what alerted Samuel J. May to Charles C. Burleigh and his powerful editorial voice. It is included here as an important part of the pre-history of <em>The Unionist</em>, as well as being an outstanding example of Charles C. Burleigh's writing style at this point in his career. <em>The Genius of Temperance</em>, edited by William Goodall, was a mainstay of support to the Canterbury Female Academy. Goodall's long career in reform included a significant level of support for women's rights.

☞ “The following paragraph is
  extracted from the Unionist of last week”
</p>
<p>
  “’The laudable efforts of the Canterbury worthies to drive Miss Crandall from
  her purpose, by withholding from her the necessaries of life, will have the
  effect to perpetuate their own well earned fame, if not to attain its primary
  object. The latest measure which we have heard of their adopting, is the
  FILLING MISS C’S WELL WITH MANURE FROM THE BARNYARD,
  <em>and then refusing to give her water from their own wells.’”</em>
</p>
"		<p>The vigilante violence and harassment of the Canterbury Female Academy was continuous, malicious, and often crudely immature, as in this instance. Putting dung into drinking water can be life-threatening, and coupled with the white villagers' unwillingness to assist the Academy by delivering fresh water, this incident revealed the depth of inhuman disdain that the white villagers had.</p><p>This article was reprinted in both <em>The Liberator</em> and the <em>Antimasonic Intelligencer</em>. The latter paper gave the following spirited setting to the <em>Unionist</em> ecerpt:</p><p>BEAUTIES OF CANTERBURY.- - The paragraph quoted below from the Unionist, is a fine specimen of the courtesy which the 'citizens' of that place are wont to display towards an amiable and respectable lady. The 'slow unmoving finger of scorn' should ever be pointed at the perpetrators and approvers of this <em>foul</em> deed. And yet we doubt not that those editors who sanction the judividal proceedings against Miss Crandall, will permit this transaction to pass by without one word of comment or reprobation, and perhaps even without publishing it to their readers."</p>	Prudence Crandall
Negative Reception for The Unionist	Columbian Register	Criticism of The Unionist	" <p>“FOR THE REGISTER”</p>
<p>“THE UNIONIST” </p>
<p>“A Distinguished gentleman from Windham County, recently in this city, informs that the Unionist, printed at Brooklyn, is distributed gratis throughout the country. Arthur Tappan, a few days before issuing the first number, went to Brooklyn, and conferred with the Rev. Mr. May, the Unitarian clergyman there—both proceeded to Canterbury, on a visit to Miss Crandall, and returned to Brooklyn; the printing house was set in order, and the new paper appeared.</p>
<p>It seems this paper is a joint effort of Abolitionism and Anti-Masonry, Unitarianism and Temperance—a rare <em>union</em> of valuable elements.</p>
<p>Will the Congregational Clergy and the ultra orthodox range themselves with Arthur Tappan and his heretical compeer? We shall see.</p>
<p>The Litchfield Enquirer is endeavoring to raise an excitement on the subject of the Canterbury law, thinking perhaps, that if the question were put to the inhabitants of Litchfield, whether they would consent to the establishment of a negro school among them, in addition to their present schools, they would answer in the affirmative. But in this he may be mistaken.</p>
<p>The shouting horn of federal sedition this year, is to be the Canterbury negro school, and the dissection law.</p>
<p>ANDOVER</p>"		Note here the attempt to paint Unitarianism as suspect, and to indicate that Tappan's alliance with Samuel J. May is likewise suspicious – conversely it points to the wide range of religious tolerance and coexistence in the ranks of the Abolitionists. <em>The Columbian Register</em>, based in New Haven, had been a leading voice of opposition to the proposed Manual Labor College for Black men in 1831.

Positive Reception for The Unionist	The Liberator	The Unionist	The Unionist.’ Such is the title of a new paper just established in Brooklyn, Conn. It is edited by Charles C. Burleigh, a gentleman of talents and uncompromising integrity; and has for its motto the inspired declaration, <em>‘Righteousness exalteth a nation.’</em> In accordance with the spirit of this motto, we find the editor is opposed to the oppressive law concerning Miss Crandall’s school, and has enlisted warmly in her defence. The other paper in that place is under the control of the dominant party, and is in fact the mouthpiece of Judson and his associate. On this account we hail the establishment of a new paper with joy. We trust it will receive an adequate support from the friends of truth and the enemies of oppression in that quarter.		<em>The Liberator</em>, the most significant Abolitionist newspaper of the time, was an avid supporter of <em>The Unionist</em> from the start.	Charles C. Burleigh; Andrew Judson; Prudence Crandall
Positive Reception for The Unionist	Haverhill Gazette	The Unionist	<em>“The Unionist”</em> is the title of a paper just established at Brooklyn, Conn. It zealously espouses the cause of the persecuted Miss Crandall, advocates the immediate abolition of slavery, and justly denounces the foolish and wicked law of Connecticut, which imposes a penalty for teaching colored persons to read. It seems, the necessity for the establishment of this paper arose from the fact, that the friends of constitutional liberty were excluded from the columns of the other. It handles the projectors and advocates of the <em>“black </em>law” with merited severity; and we ardently hope that since the editor has raised the standard of freedom, he will keep it unfurled, so long as a single advocate of slavery in any form shall dare to raises his hateful head in our country.		The Haverhill Gazette was, at times, under the editorial guidance of John Greenleaf Whittier, which may explain this strong support.	Prudence Crandall
Positive Reception for The Unionist	Schenectady Cabinet	The Unionist	THE UNIONIST.—This is the title of a new paper just commenced at Brooklyn, Connecticut; edited and published by CHARLES C. BURLEIGH. We have received the first number, and are much pleased with its appearance. Pledged to no party, but taking for its motto the glorious truth—“Righteousness exalteth a nation!”—it avows its determination to exert its influence for the promotion of virtue and the suppression of vice. Upon the subject of A.T. Judson’s “black law,” it speaks fearlessly, independently, dispassionately. We wish the new paper success, and from our knowledge of the talents and stern moral integrity of its editor, we know it will deserve it.		The Schnectady Cabinet would prove to be a strong ally to the Abolitionist cause.	Charles C. Burleigh; Andrew Judson; Prudence Crandall
Positive Reception for The Unionist	Boston Traveler	The Unionist	THE UNIONIST.—A new paper, with this title, has been commenced, within a few weeks, at Brooklyn, Con. It is edited by C. C. Burleigh, and advocates the doctrine of the immediate emancipation of slaves in the United States.		This notice remains factual rather than constituting an endorsement or attack.	Charles C. Burleigh
Negative Reception for The Unionist	Windham Times	The Unionist	We have received the first number of a new paper published at Brooklyn in this state called <em>“the Unionist.”</em> It proposes to be an <em>independent </em>paper, which means absolute <em>dependence</em> on two or three individuals—it is a <em>one-party</em> paper which is to be understood as opposing the democratic party—and <em>unionist</em> signifies disunion, discord and dissension, provided it is in the power of two or three persons of long purses, negro friendship and church and State view to create them. The Advertiser which is printed at Brooklyn is conducted with far more ability than any paper which ever preceded it in that county, and is more expressive of the feelings and sentiments of the citizens. We doubt whether Tappan &amp; Co. will be able to control the people of Windham county, or whether it is in this power to enlighten them. They best know their own interest, and the <em>Unionist</em> will not <em>unite</em> them in favor of the negro school.	This article reprinted in <em>Eastern Argus</em> 9 Aug 1833, with the title “Another Snake in the Grass” and credits the <em>Hartford Times</em> rather than the <em>Windham Times</em>	The Windham Times, aligned with the pro-colonizationist and Jacksonian forces, is unimpressed with The Unionist	Arthur Tappan
Negative Reception for The Unionist	Columbian Register	The Unionist	“A paper has just been established at Brooklyn, Windham Co. called “The Unionist,” by Charles C. Burleigh, Esq. It is a red hot Abolitionist, and its columns are filled with the martyrdom of Miss Prudence Crandall. It has much to say of Col. Judson’s negro oppression law, Watkins’ cell, &amp;c. &amp;c. Instead of Unionist, the paper should have been called Divisionist, Rebellionist, Pull off your Hat to the Blackist, and Knock your Teeth down your Throatist; and the editor, instead of announcing his name as Chas. Burleigh, should say, “published by Hurly Burly, near Canterbury.”		The Columbian Register of New Haven was always a stalwart opponent of Black civil rights in the United States. As masters of newspaper sarcasm, the use of "Hurly Burly" to describe Charles C. Burleigh is to be expected.	Charles C. Burleigh; Andrew Judson; Prudence Crandall; Oliver Watkins
Negative Reception for The Unionist	Norwich Republican	The Unionist	“THE UNIONIST.”—This is the title of a new paper lately established in Brooklyn, Conn, and is edited with considerable tact, by Mr. C.C. Burleigh. The object of the editor seems to be, to sustain Miss Crandall in her negro business,—and to cut short the influence of our brother typo, the editor of the Advertiser. Brooklyn is celebrated for creating newspaper establishments, but the people “don’t take,” or some other reason, causes them to sicken and die very soon after they are brought into being. The practice of starting newspapers in every town containing 500 inhabitants, as is prevalent at the present day, is very much to be deprecated. The projectors too frequently neglect to “count the cost,” and they soon find that a large amount is invested but little profit realized. How the case may be with the “Unionist,” we know not. But if the editor fulfils his promise contained in the prospectus, to “advocate temperance, virtue and sound morality,” we must earnestly wish him success in the undertaking.		This is a rather balanced assessment of <em>The Unionist</em> and its chances for long-term success.	Charles C. Burleigh; Andrew Judson; Prudence Crandall

Extract. From a Fourth of July Address	The Unionist	Anti-Slavery	"<p align=""center"">EXTRACT.</p>
<p align=""center""><em>From a </em>4<em><sup>th</sup></em><em> of July address.</em></p>
<p>What, let us consider, was the specific object of our Fathers’ labors and their sacrifices? It was, that they might secure to their posterity, if not to themselves, the rights of man, the blessings of civil and religious liberty, the prerogative of self-government. Who, when he reflects that this was their object, and how steadily they kept it in view, can hesitate to accord to them a higher praise, than is due to the founders of any other nation? It was, let us repeat, the moral character of the American Revolution, which gave it its peculiar grandeur. Do you feel any veneration, any love for Washington and his com-patriots, merely on account of the bloody battles they fought? You ought not. You should recoil with horror from scenes of blood, let the actors in them have been who they may. The heroes of our Revolution, it is true, fought bravely, desperately. But this alone would be equivocal applause. It was the purity of their intentions, their self-devotion to the cause of Liberty, which makes them deservedly the pride of our country, and the honor of our race. The battles which they fought, the thousands of fellow-beings whom they slew, were incidents in the prosecution of their undertaking, which the benevolent can never think of, but with sorrow and loathing.</p>
<p>It is then, we say again, the great moral purpose of the Revolution, which commends it, and those who conducted it, to our most grateful remembrance. How ardent and unfeigned they were in their love of Liberty, is evident not more in what they did and suffered during the contest, than in the provisions they afterwards made for the protection of our rights.— Ere they had laid aside their arms, all fresh from the scenes of danger and of loss through which they had passed, our fathers instituted a form of government, which excluded themselves no less than it excluded others from all distinctions of honor or profit, but such as their fellow citizens might freely accord to them. The principles on which they based our civil fabric are broad and deep. Their recognition of these as the only just foundation of human governments, gives us the clearest evidence that they were men of high intellectual power, and of unparalleled integrity. They promulgated doctrines, the truth and value of which are not yet fully realized. Hereafter, their wisdom and foresight will be more justly, that is to say, more highly appreciated. — Certain momentous questions are now agitating our Republic, and others are soon coming up to trouble us, which might at once be settled by a candid appeal to the constitution which they bequeathed us. —If we guide our political and religious affairs by the plain principles therein propounded, we shall avert those evils, which now threaten our very existence as a united people. But if we disregard them, the most fearful consequences are inevitable.</p>
<p>Our fathers declared that all men are created equal, with a right to freedom — A declaration of infinite import! A glorious, gospel, heaven inspired truth! If we deeply feel and duly regard this, whose rights or feelings shall we violate? This is a truth which ought to be indelibly engraven on every heart. It should control all the measures of government, and the deportment of individuals towards each other. It is <em>the</em> truth, out of which arise those principles, that should guide the intercourse of man with man, and of one community with another, both in respect to their civil and their religious concerns. It is but a new version of our Saviour’s golden rule.</p>
<p>By the result of those measures, which were determined upon fifty-seven years ago, we have been called unto liberty. Let us seriously reflect upon the nature and extent of the blessing, that we may not use it for an occasion to the flesh, but in willing obedience to God and his Christ, whose service alone is perfect freedom.</p>
<p>Think not, brethren, that ye are free because your fathers threw off the yoke of colonial subjection. Think not that ye are free because ye have no king, nor hereditary nobility to reign over you. Think not that ye are free because ye live in a country where the supreme power is in the hands of the people. Such are indeed the highly favorable circumstances of your condition; and yet you may be in bondage, more abject than that from which our fathers were delivered. You may be in bondage to the majority, whose will, if the principles of our constitution be forgotten, may become as absolute and arbitrary as the will of any despot. You may be the creatures of your own party or sect, to whose opinions you may be compelled to assent, and in whose projects you may be obliged to toil, on pain of expulsion from their ranks, and the odium of an outcast. Or worse than all, you may be the slaves of some prevailing vice, or of some wicked or foolish custom.</p>
<p>It was obviously the intention of those who framed our constitution, to sustain every man in forming his own opinions on all subjects, and in acting in accordance with his own opinions, unless they would lead him to violate the equal rights of another. But there are indications every where, that this wise intention of our fathers has already come to be often disregarded. Unmindful of their high individual responsibility, the mass of our people, instead of examining and judging for themselves, seem willing that others should shape their opinions and guide their actions. Though they loudly boast of their freedom, they are the humble servants of “the few.” In consequence, they have become arrayed in parties and sects, the country over, with their general and subordinate leaders, and their organs of inter-communication. What their leaders declare to them, they believe too often, it is feared, without inquiry. Whithersoever their leaders go, they follow, nothing doubting. This is, we believe, too just an account of our religious and political affairs. It is rarely, very rarely, that we see an individual thinking and acting without an undue defence to some party. — How continually do we perceive in large bodies of men, a sameness of opinion and a unity of action, which there could not, would not be, if it were not for some <em>master</em> minds controlling them with absolute authority. Ye have witnessed the struggles of the rival factions in our land. Have ye thought their zeal has been according to knowledge? Have ye seen reason to believe that the individuals, on either side, thoroughly understood the merits of their cause? And that each one acted as his own best judgment and kind feelings dictated? Has it not rather been apparent to you that the individual merged himself in his party, feeling it safe for him to act in concert with numbers; and fearing, that if he should dare to stand alone, withholding himself from both sides, he might be considered trust-worthy by neither, and perhaps would incur some more distinct expression of their displeasure? Do we then exercise and enjoy, as we might and ought to do, that civil and religious liberty of which we are so boastful?</p>
<p>These are a few of many questions, which should be pressed upon the serious consideration of every one. Our limits forbid us to mention several others, which have been suggested to our minds by the return of this season. We wish to see the anniversary of our independence devoted to higher purposes, than it has usually been. There has been enough, and more than enough of self-gratulation. We have taken too much credit to ourselves for the deeds of our fathers. Let us do them and ourselves a higher honor. Let us emulate their excellences and shun their errors.—Indeed let us not be satisfied until we surpass them in knowledge and in virtue; as the superior advantages they procured for us should enable us to do. Let us make a wider and a higher application, than they did, of the great principles for which they so nobly contended. Let us not rest satisfied with our liberty, while aught of slavery abides in our land.</p>"	Authorship unclear	While no author is given, this might well be Samuel J. May's contribution.

The Spirit of Reform	The Unionist	Allied Reform Movements - general	"<p align=""center"">THE SPIRIT OF REFORM.</p>
<p>What is the spirit of reform? What is it that has animated and enabled men from time to time to become reformers, not disturbers, but true reformers; and not religious reformers alone, but moral reformers of all descriptions? Has it not been a sense of independence and personal responsibleness, and of superiority to what are usually termed existing circumstances and the spirit of the age?</p>
<p>A very large proportion of the evil which has always existed in society, may be traced to the want of personal independence, and disregard of personal responsibility. We do not mean by independence that fiery essence of pride and selfishness, which is quick to resent a slight or wrong; which is always ready to meet aggression more than half way; and which delights to show itself in rudeness or haughtiness, as its condition may happen to be low or high. For such independence we have little sympathy and less respect, and so far from thinking that there is a want of it in the world, can only lament that there is such a superfluity. By independence we mean another and a far different thing.—We mean the resolution which adopts, and maintains, and obeys its own standard of right and wrong; which refuses to render an unquestioning homage to the voice of the many; which, being based upon principle, is not to be driven to and fro by the popular breath, even should that breath rise into a whirlwind; which acknowledging allegiance to a higher than any mortal authority, will not forfeit it at the behest of any. This is the independence which leaves to a man his own views and convictions, his own conscience, and his own conduct. Without inciting or suffering him to be forward or boisterous, it makes him steadfast and sure. Without obliging him to feel an uncharitable scorn of public opinion, it offers a rule to his admiration and observance which is alone worthy of serious study, and entitled to his faithful submission,—the great rule of right, the solemn law of God. It teaches him to consider himself as responsible for his thoughts and actions, in the first and highest place, not to the multitude, but to his Maker; and in the second place, not to the multitude, but to his own soul. It leads him into a safer, happier, and more glorious path, than the broad, dusty, soiled and soiling road, which is beaten by the multitudinous and crowding world. It sets his feet and his heart at liberty, and breathes into his soul the consciousness of individual existence and value, and the sense of individual duty.</p>
<p>This is the independence, to the want of which may be traced and referred very much of past and existing evil. Not possessing it, men lose themselves, their accountability, their dignity, all that constitutes them men, in the absorbing mass; where they acquire the color, and motions, and tendencies of the mighty vortex which has engulphed them. Instead of uttering a voice of their own, they wait for an acclamation, and then they join in; instead of having opinions of their own, they listen for the prevalent opinions, and then they repeat them; instead of having a morality of their own, a religion of their own, they are content to be just as moral and just as immoral, just as religious and just as irreligious, as other people; taking the tone of the world around them, which is seldom the highest, and imbibing its sentiments, which are not always the purest. They do not test and try opinions by any self-instituted process. They do not examine manners and actions according to a fixed and exalted standard. They trouble themselves with nothing of the kind. They fall in with the great procession, without inquiring whither it is going, upwards or downwards, to a good end or a bad one; it is enough for them that they are going with it. Thus it comes that so many think evil is metamorphosed into good, when they see the multitude practise it, and good is turned into evil, when they see the multitude slight, or forsake, or forbid it. And thus it comes, that the amount of evil is so vastly increased, because there are so many who blindly and carelessly, or cowardly, without using their own eyes to observe, or their own minds to prove, follow the multitude to do it.</p>
<p>But must we be singular? Must we be eccentric? Must we do nothing that others do; say nothing that others say?—Must we be perpetually quarrelling with society about its usages and habits? No. We are to do none of these things. It is best that we should follow the many in all ways which are indifferent; perhaps it is best that we should follow them in some ways which are inconvenient; but we must not follow them to do evil. “Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil.” That is the simple commandment. It is very true that singularity and eccentricity, when they come from a causeless, wilful, diseased principle of opposition to general custom and sentiment, are no virtues; but even then they partake no more of the nature of sin, than does a servile acquiescence in general custom and sentiment.—Without doubt, public opinion, on most points, is worthy of respectful attention and examination; but, after you have examined it by the great and permanent light within, after you have weighed it in the balance of truth and the gospel, and found it false and wanting, reject and oppose it, and if your decision is to be called singularity and eccentricity, let it be called so, and, in the name of all that is true and holy, be singular and eccentric. We are not required to dispute with the world step by step; we are not required to be solitary and to forsake the world; we are rather called upon to do all the good we can in it, and receive all the good we can from it. But we are required to recognize a higher authority than the world’s will; to obey a more sacred commandment than the world’s law. We are required to form moral and religious principles of our own, and to regulate our commerce with the world. If we will not do this, we shall do evil; for we shall do whatever the multitude does, and the multitude often does evil. The reason why so many follow a multitude to do evil, is, that they want moral independence, and do not hold themselves individually accountable to their own spirit, or to the Father of Spirits.</p>"	Authorship unclear	This editorial extols those who live by steadfast principles, rather than ego, conceit, self-interest, or the whims of popular opinion.

Popular Education, Politically Considered	The Unionist	Allied Reform Movements - education	"<p align=""center"">POPULAR EDUCATION,</p>
<p align=""center"">POLITICALLY CONSIDERED.</p>
<p>Allowing what we are so continually boasting about, that more information is universally diffused among us than among any people on earth, and that all are at liberty to acquire knowledge to any extent, still it cannot be denied, that there is prevalent a great deal of ignorance on many subjects of paramount importance. It is nothing to the purpose—it is no consolation whatever to insist, that still we are superior in this respect to other communities. The only question for us to consider is—whether the people of this country have as much knowledge, as is indispensable to their temporal and eternal well-being—their social or individual happiness? Whether there is no need of earnestly reiterating every where among then the exhortation of the wise man “get wisdom, get understanding?”</p>
<p>I am well aware that much is <em>said</em> about the necessity of a general diffusion of knowledge to the preservation of our political constitution. But in respect to this point alone, I question if there be common among us a clear perception, and deep feeling of its importance. Else why is it that in many of our States scarcely any provision, and in some none whatever, is made for the instruction of youth; and that even in those States, which have long been applauded for the great number of their schools, a large proportion of these have ever been and still are inadequate to the purpose for which they were instituted. Though we have in New England much of the form of public education, the reality is generally wanting. Very few, in comparison with the whole number of those who attend our common schools, very few leave them possessed of those elements of good learning, which it is pretended are taught there. Very few indeed who can write their thoughts on any subject with propriety and ease; and not many more who can read the thoughts of others with facility and pleasure. Most that is really acquired at these schools, even by those who make the best use of the advantages afforded in them, is a sort of verbal acquaintance with three or four elementary sciences. They do not acquire there the use of the higher powers of mind—thinking, reasoning, judging—and our youth, excepting in the few instances of those who receive good instruction at home, go forth into the world, mingle in the collisions, and assume more or fewer of the offices of society without knowing how to distinguish between many things that differ essentially. They at once fall into the ranks of this party or that, and are content to swell the number of those, who cry out for one popular leader or another—for this system of measures or that.</p>
<p>Although we often hear it said, an every body concurs in the sentiment, that a federal republic cannot long be maintained unless the people generally are well informed, yet I ask what school, yes what single school can be named, where the great principles of civil government are taught, and the peculiar characteristics of our Federal constitution. These, like all other great principles, are simple, and not hard to be understood, unless, the mind has been warped by a regard to sectional interests, or the schemes of a faction.—What young man of common sense might not easily be made, even before he leaves school, to understand these things perfectly? And if all young men were, as they should be, thus taught, moreover made to realize deeply their individual responsibilities as freemen, how difficult would it be to make them the creatures of a party, and to impose upon them as is continually done by factious men. But instead of this, how true it is, and sad as it is true, that most of our young men are left to learn all they are to know of political science, and of their own duties as members of a great Republic, amidst the contests of rival factions, and from those whose opinions have been warped by sectional interests and party passions.</p>
<p>Let it not be said, that I would impose upon the private citizen a degree of knowledge, which it can be needful only for pubic functionaries, or men of great influence in the community to possess. Let it not be objected, that I am urging the example even of a king upon every one, who hears me. Let it not be urged, that Solomon had a need of great wisdom which any of us have not; and that it is not worthwhile for all our young men to seek knowledge with as much ardor as he did, because only a few can rise to places of important trust. I say let not such sentiments be uttered, especially in this country. For is not the doctrine of hereditary right to rank utterly denounced among us? Are we not <em>all</em> born kings and princes as much as any one? Does not the supreme power emanate from ourselves? Are not <em>the people</em> the sovereign of the land?—Whom they will, they set up, and whom they will, they put down. And surely no one can foretell, which of our youth will hereafter be chosen by their fellow citizens to offices, the duties of which nothing less than the wisdom and understanding of Solomon would qualify them to discharge well.</p>
<p>As every man in the course of events may be called upon to serve the public, every man should qualify himself to do so in the best manner possible. But suppose that ninety out of a hundred of our youth may never be placed in office, be it remembered they are all to take a part in conferring offices; and this, though unhappily it is lightly esteemed, is a duty no less than a privilege of greatest moment. He is not fit to be a freeman, who does not hold his right of suffrage most sacred; too sacred to be prostituted to a party, not less than to the will of an individual usurper! He is not fit to have the right of suffrage, who does not hold his high prerogative in such esteem, that he will not exercise it but upon independent and rational conviction! And such a conviction cannot be formed in a mind that is unenlightened. Can any one deny that the more wisdom an individual may have, the more valuable he will be to the country, though he may never be known in public life?—If all our private citizens were as wise as Solomon, would it not be all the better for themselves and for the nation? Surely so! else are the fundamental principles of our civil constitution false!!</p>"	Authorship unclear	The authorship is not given, so perhaps it is written by Charles C.

Anecdote	London New Monthly Magazine	Anti-Slavery	"<p>ANECDOTE.—The following anecdote is related in the London New Monthly Magazine for last month.</p>
<p>In that inglorious attack on Buenos Ayres, where our brave soldiers were disgraced by a recreant general, the negroes, slaves as they were, joined the inhabitants to expel the invaders. On this signal occasion, the city decreed a public expression of their gratitude to the negroes, in a sort of triumph, and at the same time awarded the freedom of eighty of their leaders. One of them having shown his claims to the boon, declared that to obtain his freedom had all his life formed the proud object of his wishes; his claim was indisputable; yet now however, to the amazement of the judges, he refused his proffered freedom! The reason he alleged was a singular refinement of heartfelt sensibility: ‘My kind mistress,’ said the negro, ‘once wealthy, has fallen into misfortunes in her infirm old age. I work to maintain her, and at intervals of leisure she leans on my arm to take the evening air. I will not be tempted to abandon her; and I renounce the hope of freedom that she may know she possesses a slave who will never quit her side.'</p>"		This is a serious misstep, as it enhaces a stereotype of the gentle slave who remains loyal to the master even when freedom is allowed. This sort of tone-deafness doesn't happen much in later issues.

"The Advertiser has taken us to task"	The Unionist	Journalistic Debate	"<p align=""center"">THE UNIONIST.</p>
<p align=""center"">BROOKLYN, AUGUST 8, 1833.</p>
<p>The Advertiser has taken us to task quite severely, for what, with his moral accuracy, he calls our “false pretences” or “gross inconsistency.” The irresistible reasoning, by which he arrives at a conclusion so unfavorable to us, deserves a passing notice. After quoting from our prospectus, a sentence showing our disapprobation of the dominant party in our last Legislature, he goes on with the confident air of a man who thinks he cannot be mistaken, “what is this but an acknowledged preference for, and a devotion to a political party?” How conclusive! Because we disapprove one political party, we must necessarily—not merely approve, but be <em>devoted</em> to another. Because we have expressed a hope that one party will not reign long, “it follows” that we shall endeavor to transfer the rule to another. Admirable logic!</p>
<p>To the Advertiser’s assertion that the paper originated in party feeling and from unworthy motives, we answer, (first asking by the way, who probably knows our motives best, we or the Advertiser,) that it matters little to what motives the establishment of the Unionist is attributable, so long as its <em>course</em> is fair, upright and consistent with its professions. If the Advertiser will pursue such a course, we will promise to say nothing about the motives which induced its change from the “bitter hostility to President Jackson and his friends” which it manifested “for nearly five years,” to a course and character diametrically opposite. We will not even hint that the <em>disinterested</em> Advertiser which resolves to “continue firm and unflinching in the pursuance of its duty, so long as it has one reader left,” was <em>bought up</em> by the Jackson party.</p>
<p>But it is said that we are not consistent with our professions. We will not take it upon us to say whether, in making this charge, the Advertiser man has exposed his incapacity to comprehend the plain import of language, or has shown a disposition, wilfully to pervert the truth. One of the two is evident. That we do not possess experience “in getting up independent papers,” headed with professions at variance with our intended practice, or in any other species of deception, which would enable us to impose upon the public and yet escape suspicion, we freely confess; nor is it our desire at present to avail ourselves of the superior experience in such matters of any of our editorial brethren. When we engage in an enterprise which requires that kind of experience, we shall doubtless call in the assistance of such of our acquaintance as are best versed in the mystery of making promises to be “revoked.” But that we are incompetent to the easy task of telling the truth, (for we consider it easy, whatever the Advertiser may think of it,) in plain, intelligible language, we are unwilling yet to admit. We refer any candid man, to our prospectus, and the leading article of our first number, for evidence that we have spoken intelligibly; and to the whole of that sheet, and of this also, for proof that, so far as we can be judged by our acts, what we said was <em>truth</em> that we have been consistent with our professions. We ask our readers to compare with the evidence thus collected, the leading article and several other pieces in the last Advertiser, and say if that paper has not misrepresented us. We have never represented ourselves as indifferent or neutral on the questions moral or political, at present agitating the community, nor are we so. We have opinions which we shall defend to the extent of our poor ability, for their defence this paper was established. In our leading article last week, we alluded to the fact that “the majority had no organ of communication,” as one reason why some gentlemen opposed in sentiment to the Advertiser, had put in operation this press, one object of which would be, to counteract the effect of the Advertiser’s unfair course. Now does not this show clearly, that in charging us as guilty of inconsistency because we oppose the measures he advocates, the Advertiser editor brings against us a groundless accusation.</p>
<p>But it will perhaps be said, we are pledged to no party. And so we are. Can the Advertiser see no difference between opposing his party and supporting another? Cannot this paper be made the organ of the majority, and yet be the exclusive organ of no party? If he will lay his finger on the passage in our paper in which we advocate any party as such, or in any way depart from our expressed design of canvassing the claims of men and the propriety of measures on their own merits, then will we acknowledge our offence, and humbly ask forgiveness and promise amendment, nor will we “revoke our promise” before the week’s end, even should he tell his readers we have made it.</p>
<p>While we thus openly declare that we are not indifferent on the subjects which have been noticed in our paper, we still adhere to our avowal, that we shall discuss them and give our opinions upon them, without reference to the circumstances that this or that party holds sentiments similar to, or differing from ours, we shall also admit properly written communications against, as well as in favor of our views. If this will not constitute our paper as independent one, we acknowledge our ignorance of the meaning of the term.</p>
<p>When the Advertiser detects us departing from this course, he may then complain of us, as we have done of him, for being one sided, and may call ours a “counterfeit independent paper.” And when we perceive him pursuing a course like this, we will acknowledge his right to the praise of <em>genuine</em> independence. But till then we shall consider ourselves justified in adhering to our original assertion, that the <em>want of fairness and independence </em>in the Advertiser, led to the establishment at this time, of another paper.</p>"		There would be much in the way of partisan posturing between Charles C. Burleigh and the editors of the local newspapers that opposed the Canterbury Female Academy. He is forthright here, and reinforces that The Unionist is not "indifferent or neutral on the questions moral or political, at present agitating the community," meaning the issues around race, citizenship, women's education, and abolition raised by the Canterbury Female Academy.
"We cannot but admire the facility"	The Unionist	Journalistic Debate	"<p>We cannot but admire the facility with which the Editor of the Advertiser disposes of his promises, which like the poets’ oaths,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Are but words, and words but wind</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Too feeble instruments to bind.”</p>
<p>It is not every man that can make a promise Monday, and “revoke” it by the middle of the same week, but that faculty seems to belong in a rather eminent degree to our “courteous” neighbor. Nor is our admiration much less, when we notice his ingenious method of convincing those who, he thinks, doubt the correctness of his assertions. “I have a letter to show,” says the Editor. A “certain person” calls and requests a sight of it. Oh! I have lent it, but you shall see it when it is returned. The “person” relates the transaction just as it occurred, and without note or comment. “You doubt my word” exclaims the Advertiser, “you insinuate that I never had the letter, and now <em>you</em> shan’t see it.” Who can resist the conviction that he certainly had the letter, as he said.—Now we assure the Advertiser man that we have no desire to see the document if he does not wish it. And farther if it will afford him any consolation we will add, that it was never our intention to insinuate that it had not been in his possession, nor do we believe that our plain narrative contains any such insinuation.</p>"		Accusations of dissimulation between Burleigh and James Holbrook, editor of the Windham Advertiser.

"Who pays," asks the Advertiser	The Unionist	Journalistic Debate	“Who pays?” asks the Advertiser. We of course feel deeply sensible of the honor done us by the solicitude our kind neighbor manifests about our affairs, and therefore instead of replying, (in the laconic style in which <em>we</em> should expect to be answered, were we to ask such questions,)—it is none of your business,—we will inform the Advertiser for his especial benefit, that we seriously think of adopting the novel expedient of requiring those to pay, who take the paper. If the people of this county and vicinity choose to support our paper it will go on, if not, then to calm the fears of our self-appointed guardian, we assure him, that we have no intention of continuing it. We are somewhat at a loss to discover how our neighbor is so much better acquainted with our business, than we are, but his assertion that no arrangements have been made to prepare subscribers for this paper, is either a proof that he is so, or another evidence of his happy talent, for manufacturing facts. Had he not given us this information, (which is certainly as new to us as anything contained in his sheet,) we should have firmly believed that we <em>had</em> made “arrangements to procure subscribers,” nay more, that our arrangements had not been wholly ineffectual. But if the Advertiser knows better, why! We must be mistaken, that’s all.		<em>The Unionist</em> received considerable financial backing from the wealthy New York merchant and Abolitionist Arthur Tappan. This connection appeared suspicious to James Holbrook of the <em>Windham Advertiser</em>, who made insinuations against <em>The Unionist</em> as a result. This is Burleigh's reply to these attacks.

We confess having spoken without sufficient reflection	The Unionist	Journalistic Debate	We confess having spoken without sufficient reflection, in saying that the Advertiser is <em>bound by</em> express promises. We now amend; by substituting for that complained of, the assertion that the Advertiser <em>has made</em> an express promise in respect to the course he should pursue. We allude to his promising admission to communications on both sides of the Canterbury question, a promise of which we presume he will not require the “measurement,” since he has, by assigning his reasons for so doing, admitted having made and revoked it. But if he chooses to have it that he has made no express promises to conduct his paper "with that independence and fairness which ought to characterize a public journal," we are willing he should have it so, and if he prefers to set in such a manner as shows that he considers himself under no implied obligation to that fairness, why! Let him so act. But really, we did not expect he would publicly take exceptions to our declaration, that he is bound to conduct with that “fairness which <em>ought to characterize</em> a public journal.”		As is true in today's media environment, the promise to represent "all sides" is often made disingenuously.

Denial of an attack on The Unionist office	The Unionist	Vigilante Violence	We are sorry to hear that some evil disposed, or heedlessly mischievous person has circulated a story, that our office has been entered with violence, and our types &amp;c. broken, destroyed, or scattered about the building and the streets. We hope the story has gained no more credence than it deserves, for to believe it, would be great injustice to the quiet and orderly people of Brooklyn. We would humbly hope moreover, that our contemplated course is not so displeasing to the people as to excite them to such an action even if they were,—as we are sure they are not—disposed to adopt violent measures to serve their ends. The indications of public favor which we have already perceived, encourage us to believe, that so far from being put down by force, we shall be sustained by the countenance and patronage of a candid (not “credulous”) community.		The fact that Burleigh denies there was an attack on the office vouches for his honesty; he eschews any attempt to gain sympathy by pretending there was an attack.

Letter to the Editor	The Unionist	Constitution	"<p align=""right"">FOR THE UNIONIST.</p>
<p>MR. EDITOR.—It is often said that the perpetuity of our peculiar form of government, and the preservation of our free institutions, which are in truth the chief glory of our land, depend upon the INTELLIGENCE and VIRTUE of the people; this has been so often repeated and so universally assented to, that it has come to be a trite political maxim. Now suppose, or rather admit, the people of Connecticut to be an <em>intelligent people, </em>what will be one of the necessary consequences resulting from the admission? Surely that the people themselves examine the spirit and tendency of all laws which are to be enforced among them; and further that they see and know that their Representatives in the exercise of their delegated power, do not transcend the limits prescribed them by the Constitution, which is a gauge in the hand of the Constituent to be applied to acts of the delegate.</p>
<p>The Constitution was not made for the Executive, nor the Legislative, nor the Judicial department of the Government! For whom then was it made? The people made it, and they made it for themselves and for their posterity; it is then emphatically the people’s; and on its provisions they rely, for its support they will contend, and by its spirit and its letter shall their privileges and immunities be adjudged. It is a mighty shield, which the humblest citizen may lift up between himself and the inflictions of injury by arbitrary, assumed authority; it is a sanctuary, to which the persecuted may flee and find ample and free protection; and it is a Haven, so safe that he who <em>anchors within </em> it, needs no <em>insurance</em>!</p>
<p>Such being the Constitution, how invaluable a treasure! What should be done to preserve it? Diffuse knowledge through the land,—open the fountains of intelligence,—be as Catholic in matters of Education, as you are tolerant in religion,—be in fact, what you are in profession,—a Democracy, and let the INTELLIGENCE be, where the POWER is, in the People! Then, and not till then, will the symmetry of our inimitable form of Government shine forth in the full splendor and beauty of its exact proportions; then, and not till then, will the harsh notes of discord cease, and be succeeded by a deep and national euphony sweeping over the land, and by its magic strains charming to the standard of the Constitution, every lover of his race,—of his Country and of his God. Who that is at all competent to examine with understanding the Constitution of the U. States—to perceive its checks and balances—where power is imparted and where again, it operates with restraining force—where provisions are made for an efficient and energetic administration of the government, and in case of abuse, the <em>Cavesson</em> placed in the hands of the people—to see with a philanthropic ken, the beautiful and harmonious distributions of the functions of Government, among the various departments, and above all to perceive and realize that, with the framers of this revered instrument, the ultimate object, after all was the security and happiness o the people,—who that can do this, will not wish the Constitution of his country to remain inviolate, and be desirous that to the Constitutional test should be brought every doubtful or ambiguous enactment of State Legislatures? Although I detest all petty litigation by which the peace of community is many times disturbed, yet I most heartily rejoice when ever I see one of my fellow citizens on whom a law, novel in its provisions and doubtful in its tendency, is made to bear, pursuing “the peaceful and rightful remedy” by laying his complaint before a tribunal, constituted, among other things, to protect the citizen from all unconstitutional enactments upon his personal liberty, or his right of private property. The citizen who does this evinces a vigilance, and a respect for the great charter of our rights, commendable to himself, and worthy the emulation of others. What will be the prospect of the Republic, when such a deep and sickly apathy shall overtake our citizens, as that they can witness even with partial indifference any infractions upon the Constitution, their richest earthly treasure; and if its integrity be preserved, the best inheritance of their children, but, when crippled and polluted, their sorest calamity!</p>

The Question	The Unionist	Education; Canterbury Female Academy	"<p align=""center"">THE QUESTION.</p>
<p><strong>Considerable pains are taken to keep the question respecting the Canterbury School from coming fairly before the public. The following extract from Mr. May’s letter to Andrew T. Judson, Esq. presents it in the true light.</strong></p>
<p>Nothing, I am confident, could have been further from Miss Crandall’s intention, than to do her neighbors any injury. And Sir, you may rest assured, the gentlemen referred to in her Advertisement would not uphold her a moment in violating any of your rights. The determination she has formed to devote herself to the education of colored females, we cannot but highly approve. Her residence in your village is altogether a providential circumstance. We should encourage her benevolent enterprise, wherever it might be undertaken. And if a suitable situation can be provided for her, in some place where her neighbors would assist and cheer her, or where they would only not molest her, we should rejoice to have her remove thither. But you declared, in the town meeting, that the school should not be located in any part of Canterbury—and also that there is not a town in the State which would admit such a seminary within its borders. It is therefore all the more necessary that she should be sustained where she now is. It is to be deeply regretted that yourself and others are opposed to her. We think you are doing yourselves no honor; and more than that, we are persuaded you are helping to perpetuate the great iniquity, and the deep disgrace of our country. The question between us is not simply whether thirty or forty colored girls shall be well educated at a school to be kept in Canterbury; but whether the people in any part of our land will recognize and generously protect the “inalienable rights of man,” without distinction of color? If this be not done, in Connecticut, where else in our land can we expect it will be done, at least in our day? That it cannot be done even in this State without a struggle, is not most shamefully obvious. A year or two since, some benevolent individuals proposed to erect an institution, at New Haven, for the education of colored young men. The design was defeated by violent opposition. If the citizens had opposed merely its location in that City, they might have escaped condemnation, for such a seminary there might have been very prejudicial to Yale College. But it was only too apparent, that their hostility to the institution was peculiarly embittered by their prejudices against the color of those, who were to be educated at it. So too in the case at Canterbury; no one pretends there would have been any opposition to Miss Crandall’s school, if her pupils were to be white. The tincture of their skin then it is which has called out the men of influence in array against her; and has even procured from the freemen of the town an expression of their “unqualified disapprobation” of her plan.</p>
<p>Here then, in Connecticut, we have had two recent instances of outrage committed upon “the inalienable rights of man.” Among these rights, to use the language of the Declaration of Independence “are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” Now Education has from the first, been regarded in this State highly conducive to private happiness, and the public weal. Yet have our colored brethren been twice angrily denied permission to seek this blessing, to the extent they have desired. Will the people of Connecticut generally, countenance these violation of our civil and religious principles? If they will, let them no longer claim to be a republican, much less a christian people!</p>"		Samuel J. May (1797-1871) was the Unitarian minister of Brooklyn - the only Unitarian clergyman in the entire state of Connecticut at the time - and the best strategic thinker among Prudence Crandall's local white allies. Here he names the problem quite precisely: "Education has from the first, been regarded in this State highly conducive to private happiness, and the public weal. Yet have our colored brethren been twice angrily denied permission to seek this blessing." The "twice angrily denied" refers to the New Haven Manual Labor College effort of 1831, while the second denial is the Black Law against the Canterbury Female Academy.	Andrew Judson; Samuel J.

<p>
  The Journal of Commerce of July 30
  <sup>th</sup>
  has copied the statement made in the Advertiser of July 25, by Col Judson and
  Rufus Adams, Esq. and have made the following remarks upon it.
</p>
<p>
  We publish to day an article from Canterbury which has appeared in several
  papers of that neighborhood. We do so, because we understand it to be a sort
  of official declaration of the grounds upon which the law and proceedings
  under it, relative to the school for colored children in that town, are to be
  defended. We are certainly willing it should have all proper weight. Yet we
  must think the ground taken will be very difficult to maintain. The opposition
  to the school then, is made because it is a school of immediate abolition
  doctrines. This is not the ground of defence which has ever before been taken.
  The Report to the Legislature and the Law, both set forth the injurious influx
  of blacks from other states as the evil to be prevented. But whether new or
  old, the position now assumed is one which cannot be maintained under our
  institutions. We have learned, and our constitutions are based upon the
  knowledge, that the best way to put down error is by argument, not by law.
  That the best way to maintain truth and sound opinions is to leave error
  unrestrained. Admitting therefore, that the doctrines of the abolitionists are
  never so erroneous, it amounts to nothing in defence of the law; for error,
  whether religious, political, scientific, or of whatever sort, is entitled, so
  far as the laws are concerned, to set up schools and colleges, and propagate
  itself by all peaceable means, as entirely unrestrained as if it were pure
  truth. Surely in Connecticut, that focus of toleration, the doctrines of this
  defence will find no countenance. As to the improprieties in the manner of
  introducing the school, and the abusive anonymous letters which were sent to
  the gentlemen, they are certainly not matters which full grown men should set
  forth in so formidable a manner. Indeed we think that such a defence as this,
  must be with sensible men, their last effort before abandoning the cause.

<p align=""right"">CANTERBURY, CT. July 19, 1833</p>
<p>
  It may be due the public, as well as ourselves, and the town in which we
  reside, that a concise answer should be made to some of the most prominent
  aspersions cast upon us, and our fellow citizens, in connection with the
  subject of a school set up in Canterbury for “colored misses.” We had supposed
  that the principal facts were understood by the community, so that any
  exaggerated statements, false accusations, or artful insinuations, would find
  no resting place in the mind of any honest man. Lest it may be supposed that
  we acquiesce in these numerous and perverted statements, we think proper to
  present for consideration, a few circumstances, trusting that those who know
  us, will not so readily receive for truth, the assumptions of those who have
  so liberally bestowed so great a variety of epithets upon us.
</p>
<p>
  PRUDENCE CRANDALL came here with a proposition to remove her School from
  Plainfield to this place, and establish one here, for the instruction of Young
  Ladies. The citizens of Canterbury readily embraced the offer, and gave her
  their patronage. The School, continued from the Fall of 1831, until January or
  February, 1833. At that time, as we have since learned, Miss C. was proselyted
  to the
  <em>immediate Abolition</em>
  faith. She started for Boston under a fictitious pretence, and saw
  <em>Mr. Garrison,</em>
  the leader of that party. She returned home and immediately went to New York
  and came back, as she told us, with an engagement and under a contract, to
  receive into her school, twenty colored girls, with an expectation of
  increasing the number to the full extent of her accommodations. The dismission
  of her former school, and the announcement of this new project, was the first
  knowledge given to those who had patronized her. It was soon ascertained upon
  what ground the school was to be established, and what principles were to be
  inculcated. The levelling principles of the immediate abolitionists, had taken
  full possession of her mind, and it was soon made known to us,
  <em>who</em>
  were to be the patrons of the school. When we saw Arnold Buffum, and others
  associated with him, assert what they denominated her rights, and when their
  threats were poured out upon the town, and all its inhabitants, we could
  anticipate the ultimate effects upon the town.
</p>
<p>
  We distinctly state to all who may feel an interest in this matter, that we
  are not opposed to the education and kind treatment of the colored people. It
  is not in the power of any man, in truth, to say, that we have ever
  ill-treated a person of color. We desire to see them free and happy. This is
  the universal sentiment of the inhabitants of the town, so far as we know it.
  Our schools admit colored children to equal privileges, and we rejoice that
  they do so. Those schools are all visited and are under the superintendence of
  proper boards, excluding all danger, from the inculcation of erroneous
  principles. The law now in force, makes schools for foreign blacks subject to
  the assent of the civil authority and select men of each town, so that it is
  an easy matter to have such a school now, provided that board could be
  satisfied that no pernicious principles are to be inculcated, and no danger
  could arise to the town or state. Is not this right? Why should any person
  desire to force upon any community, a school of any sort, against all their
  wishes? Have the inhabitants no right to be heard in reference to the location
  of such an institution among them, and more especially when they know the
  dangerous consequences to which such measures would tend? Are the people of
  this State ready to admit that the abolitionists, as they are called, are
  diffusing sentiments and opinions consistent with the constitution and the
  peace of society? Is there any individual in the State of Connecticut, who
  would feel willing to have such a school. Together with all the necessary
  evils, situated within his own town or village? The answer, will be, no. Then
  let the same feeling be extended to us. This is the only way to ascertain
  whether the town of Canterbury has done right or wrong. The distinct objection
  which has been made by the inhabitants of the town, to the location of this
  school within its limits, consists in the dangerous tendency of the principles
  pressed by the abolitionists wherever they go, in language peculiar to
  themselves.—These principles are well understood, and it would be with deep
  regret, that any school should be established and continued, for their
  advancement, in a community where our friends are compelled to reside.*
</p>
<p>
  The manner in which Miss C. effected the change in her school, was very
  objectionable, and no friend that we have met with, can furnish any
  justification. We know of nothing that could have been done by the town, that
  has not been done, to induce her to remove the school, to some place where
  there were no objections. She has been urged by individuals—and entreated by
  committees, who have waited upon her, to give up this location of her school.
  We have heretofore stated, and we now repeat it that we offered to take the
  house at the price she had contracted to pay for it, and relieve her from any
  loss on that account. This was declined, and then the town petitioned the
  General Assembly, and the law which she, with the advice of her friends, now
  resists, was passed. Nearly a month after the rising of the Legislature, she
  was notified that a suit would be commenced by the Grand Juror. At the trial,
  her counsel gave in a demurrer to the complaint, admitting the facts true, and
  submitted to the finding of the court without argument. The Court required her
  to give bonds of $150 to appear at the net Court, which she refused to
  give.—This she had a right to do, and be committed if she chose. No one will
  say that she could not have given the bond on the spot. But it had been agreed
  before hand, by those who directed her what to do, that she should go to jail.
  She went and staid as long as suited her purposes, less than 24 hours, and
  then gave the bond. Some person has put in wide circulation, the story that
  she was confined in the cell of Watkins the murderer. This is part of the same
  contrivance to “get up more excitement!” She never was confined in the
  “murderer’s cell.” She was lodged in the debtor’s room, where every
  accommodation was provided, both for her and
  <em>her friends,</em>
  whose visits were constant. She was confined no where else. It is said in
  justification of this untruth, that Watkins, some of the last days of his
  life, was taken out of his cell to receive the clergy and his friends, in the
  debtor’s room, because it was more convenient. How does that accord with the
  statement made? Just as well might it be said by those who go into the
  meeting-house, where Watkins attended meeting some of his last Sabbaths, that
  <em>they</em>
  had been in the “murderers cell.”
</p>
<p>
  Does any one think or believe that this school, with all its evils, should be
  fixed, and permanently located here, we will just ask them to consider the
  manner too, in which this has been pressed upon us, by foreigners or persons
  residing out of town and State. If they are actuated by the pure principles of
  benevolence, how much more of that virtue they would evince to the world, by
  taking the school home to the places of their own residence. What necessity is
  there to bring persons from New York, or Philadelphia, to Canterbury? They
  certainly can be educated there quite as well, and more especially if we are
  so much like barbarians as is pretended. We wish this to be well considered,
  before blame is cast upon the town of Canterbury. Is not the peace and safety
  of community, of consequence? It will not be understood that the town ever
  entertained any danger from the girls themselves, but every person must know
  that many others will of necessity, be drawn around this nucleus, and
  connected with the principles of the abolitionists, who will not say that our
  habitations, our persons and our peace, will be insecure? In answer to this
  question, we will exhibit to the public, some of the principles,—some of this
  christian benevolence,—some of this milk of human kindness, extended to us.
  During the last week, the
  <em>“Climax”</em>
  has been circulated, and sent us from the Post office in New York, marked with
  double postage, when the gentleman from whose press it issued, might as well
  have brought it himself to us, as to others. We unequivocally say, the
  ”Climax” is a wanton perversion of truth.
</p>
<p>
  We will invite the reader to go one step further. We have received through the
  Post Office, from some zealous abolitionist, a tract, upon which is
  ingeniously written, in connection with the title of the tract, so that when
  taken together it reads as follows—viz:
</p>
<p>“Thus saith the Lord, consider your way.</p>
<p>The Eternal Misery of Hell: this place is for whom?</p>
<p>For Judge Adams and A.T. Judson.”</p>
<p>
  If the reader will not be wearied, one other specimen of this benevolent work,
  which is going on to coerce this State into these Christian measures, as they
  are denominated, shall also be exhibited to public view. On the 18
  <sup>th</sup>
  inst., one of the signers of this communication had delivered to him by the
  Post Master, a letter mailing in Pittsburg, Penn. July 12, in the following
  language:

  dastardly puppy. Hypocritical villain, a rascal of the lowest order. I cannot

Samuel J. May's response to Adams and Judson Circular	The Unionist	Abolition; White Opposition	"<p>TO RUFUS ADAMS, ESQ.,</p>
<p>AND ANDREW T. JUDSON, ESQ.</p>
<p>
  Gentlemen: I presume that the foregoing communication contains a statement of
  the case, between yourselves &amp; Miss Crandall, as favorable to yourselves,
  as you were able to make. The request to all the Editors of newspapers in the
  state, that they would republish the article is proof sufficient of the
  estimation in which it is held. Still, gentlemen, it appears to me to be any
  thing but an exculpation of yourselves. This I shall now attempt to show.
</p>
<p>
  You evidently intend it should be believed, that Miss Crandall gave the
  citizens of Canterbury just cause of offence, at first, in having so soon
  discontinued the instruction of their daughters. The charge has indeed been
  explicitly brought against her in another periodical (“the Colonizationist No.
  2”) in a letter from Canterbury, written very probably by one or the other of
  yourselves. It is there stated, that she “made numerous and solemn engagements
  with the citizens of Canterbury, that if they would aid her in the
  establishment of a school, she would continue the school for their children.
  “These engagements” says the letter-writer “she has violated without excuse.”
  If you could prove all this, Gentlemen, you would certainly prove that
  <em>she</em>
  did very wrong, but not that
  <em>you</em>
  have done right.” I will venture to say however, that if she had given up the
  office of an instructress altogether, we never should have heard a
  syllable about her “numerous, solemn engagements.” And discontinued the
  instruction of your children, if she had not first been threatened with the
  loss of your patronage, unless she dismissed from her school a colored girl,
  whom she thought it her duty to educate.† Now, gentlemen, if it be true, as
  you assert, that you and your neighbors are not opposed to the education and
  kind treatment of colored people, if you really desire to see them free and
  happy, why was Miss C. threatened with loss of patronage if she permitted
  Sarah Harris to continue as one of her pupils? You tell your readers that the
  common schools in your town admit colored children to equal privileges with
  white ones, and that you rejoice that they do so. Why then did you not rejoice
  that Miss Crandall admitted a colored girl into her school? Why! unless you
  chose that the children of colored people should enjoy the blessings of
  education, only in a very stinted measure? Answer me this if you please?
</p>
<p>
  Again. You complain, and have elsewhere complained that Miss C. made the
  change in her school abruptly—that she did it without asking the consent or
  even the advice of her former patrons. I apprehend that the blame for
  this must attach to yourselves rather than to her. If you had ever evinced,
  that interest in the education and freedom and happiness of our colored
  brethren, which you now profess to feel, there can be little doubt that she
  would have disclosed to you her feelings and her purposes; and gladly have
  availed herself of your assistance. But she perceived that you, like most of
  our white brethren, regarded the colored children of our Heavenly Father as
  doomed to degradation, and not to be admitted to equal privileges even in this
  land of boasted liberty. Therefore she did not reveal her plan until it was
  matured. She anticipated that you would oppose it. The event has proved that
  she judged correctly.
</p>
<p>
  But you assure your fellow-citizens, and have made the declaration before,
  that the main ground of your opposition to the school, has been and is that
  you know certain erroneous principles were to be inculcated there. What those
  principles are, you have not stated. You
  <em>assert</em>
  that they are very dangerous—thinking perhaps that you may thus frighten the
  community into the belief that your persecution of Miss Crandall has been
  altogether reasonable, and praiseworthy. Have not the enemies of truth, and
  freedom, and the Gospel in all ages pursued a similar course? Let us see how
  you have proceeded.
</p>
<p>
  Miss Crandall advertised in several newspapers, that she would receive into
  her family “young ladies and little misses of color” and give them instruction
  in certain branches of knowledge, which she specified. You and others in the
  village were offended at her proposal. And I venture to say that no one of you
  will deny that the real ground of your offence was, that her pupils were to be
  colored girls. If her proposals had been to receive into her family “young
  ladies and little misses” from New-York and Boston and other cities, whose
  parents would be able and willing to pay more liberally for their education,
  than we in the country are accustomed to pay for ours. I suppose not one of
  her neighbors would have dreamt of denying her the right to do so. It was then
  without doubt the color of her pupils, that was the whole ground of the
  objection made at first to her school. Instead however of frankly
  acknowledging this—acknowledging that you are unbelievers (practically at
  least) of the great truth that all men are created equal, and have an
  unalienable right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness—instead I say
  of frankly acknowledging your unbelief or your dislike of this truth, as the
  ground of your opposition, you have gone about (like the opposers of human
  improvement in all ages) to make it generally believed that the school was
  established for purposes very different from those avowed in the
  advertisement. You have tried to awaken the apprehension that the existence of
  such a school will be directly or indirectly most dangerous to the peace, and
  welfare of the country. And you now set this forth as your principal objection
  to the school.
</p>
<p>
  How should you, gentlemen, like to be dealt with in this mode? How would Col.
  Judson like to find his neighbors opposing his location in their village, on
  the presumption, that he had set up his office there, for other purposes than
  those of his profession—on the presumption that he came there to disseminate
  certain pernicious doctrines in politics or religion? How would he like it, if
  he found the people of Canterbury combined to make him discontinue his
  practice as a lawyer, or leave the town, because he is known to be a
  freemason. If his neighbors should succeed in diffusing unfriendly feelings
  towards him throughout the town, and at length procured a general meeting of
  the inhabitants to express their unqualified disapprobation of his purpose to
  continue as a lawyer among them, what would he think, what would he say, if
  after having heard himself accused of holding and intending to disseminate
  pernicious principles, his fellow citizens should refuse his permission to be
  heard in explanation and defence of his real views and purposes? Would he not
  cry out against the unrighteousness? Gentlemen, you must reverse the case, if
  you would see how your conduct appears to many, and will appear to many more.
</p>
<p>
  That some of Col. Judson’s principles are actually bad, dangerous to the peace
  of Society &amp;c. has now become most notorious. For has he not been laboring
  from the first to prevent the dissemination of what he believes to be
  erroneous and dangerous opinions, not by
  <em>showing</em>
  them to be erroneous, but by exciting the popular prejudices, and calling for
  the interference of the civil arm? And is there any principle, which has
  wrought more mischief in the world that this? All history answers, No.
</p>
<p>
  In this connexion, I will notice a false accusation which you have again
  brought against me. You accuse Mr Buffum and myself of pouring out threats
  upon the town and inhabitants. The same charge you alleged more explicitly
  against us in the Norwich Republican of March 27
  <sup>th</sup>
  . But you have never informed the public what those threats were.—Nor can you.
  None were uttered. I now declare, that I heard not a word from Mr Buffum in
  the tone or spirit of threat; and that not a syllable of the kind escaped my
  lips. I call upon you to contradict me if you please—and make your
  contradiction good if you can.
</p>
<p>
  You have taken no little pains, gentlemen, in your communication, &amp; on
  other occasions, to make it appear as if you and the people of Canterbury are
  the injured, suffering party. That you may have suffered some injury in the
  course of the unhappy collision, which you have awakened, is possibly true.
  But that any injury, any disregard to your rights and feelings was intended in
  the establishment of Miss Crandall’s school on its present plan, there is not
  the slightest reason to suppose. I can most solemnly declare, that from the
  first I have been willing to treat even your prejudices with some
  consideration. Witness my letter to Miss Crandall, dated Feb. 28
  <sup>th</sup>
  , written so soon as I heard of the opposition you were preparing to make to
  the prosecution of her plan. If I had been permitted to speak for her at your
  town meeting, as
  <em>she</em>
  requested I might be permitted to do, you would soon have learnt that neither
  Miss C. nor her patrons had any wish to force the continuance of her school in
  your village. They were, and I trust still are, willing to have it removed to
  any
  <em>suitable</em>
  place, that might be obtained for it. In a conversation with Col. Judson a few
  days after the meeting, I gave him this assurance distinctly; as he doubtless
  remembers. His reply I shall never forget. ‘No,’ said he, ‘that school shall
  not be located in any part of the town of Canterbury; no—not in part of the
  State of Connecticut. I will get a law passed,’ he continue, ‘by our next
  Legislature, prohibiting the introduction of colored from other States into
  this for the purpose of attending school.‡ I can obtain thirty thousand
  signers to a petition for such a Law.’ The same overbearing, tyrannical spirit
  was conspicuous in that gentleman’s language and manner, at the town meeting;
  and has been too apparent in many of his doings since. To protect, if I may be
  able a lone woman from the operations of such a spirit, I have felt it my duty
  to stand with others between her and her oppressors. If she has done wrong, or
  spoken unadvisedly, let her be rebuked. I would not attempt to justify her
  error. But she has rights, and they must be respected. If her location in your
  village is disagreeable to you, and you can enable her to procure suitable
  accommodations elsewhere, I for one should advise her to remove, &amp; I
  believe all her patrons would concur in the advice. But your attempt to compel
  her to abandon her school, we regard as a flagrant violation of her privileges
  as an American citizen, and we have therefore advised her to resist, peaceably
  but firmly. The law which you have procured from our last Legislature, we are
  confident is unconstitutional, and have been so advised by able civilians.—We
  have therefore thought it best for Miss C. to continue her school, until the
  validity of that Law shall have been ascertained. If it shall be found to be
  indeed a good and a valid law of Connecticut, then of course Miss Crandall and
  her patrons will peaceably abide the consequences of her violation of it. Her
  school must be abandoned; and it must then be acknowledged before the world
  “that all men are not permitted to enjoy their unalienable rights even in
  New-England.""
</p>
<p>
  I have more to say in reply to your communication; and shall resume my remarks
  next week; when I shall particularly notice the charge so often repeated by
  you, that false and dangerous principles are to be taught at Miss C’s school.
</p>
<p>SAMUEL J. MAY</p>
<p>
  *To preclude the possibility of an inference that the truth of this accusation
  is admitted, we would simply express our conviction that Miss C. has made no
  engagements, of which the discontinuance, or the change of her school could be
  considered a violation. She went to Canterbury, at least as much to confer a
  favor as to receive one, and was never under any more obligation to teach the
  children of that village, than are the merchants there to sell their goods to
  her or others, nor did she suppose the people of Canterbury to be obligated to
  send their daughters to her school, more than they were, or than she was, to
  purchase the commodities offered by those merchants.

<p>
  ‡ Col. Judson in the earnestness of his determination to overthrow Miss
  Crandall’s school, threatened that there should also be a clause in his Law,
  by which the colored people in the State should be restrained within the towns
  to which they now belong, so that even their children could not be sent to
  Miss C. for instruction. But it seems that for some wide reason he has since
  concluded to omit the proposed clause.

  —In the slave-holding States it has ever been contrary to law to bestow the

  plausible reasoning. We were not aware, however, that in the very heart of
  New-England there existed any such prohibition, until we saw it stated in the
  public prints, that a lady who had been engaged in keeping a school for blacks
  in Connecticut, had been arrested and thrown intro prison. She is placed in
  the same cell which has been occupied by a convicted murderer! There is

justified. Why should one portion of our community be deprived of privileges
enjoyed by others, merely on account of a difference of complexion? If there is
any good reason for the restrictions embraced in the law, let them at least
extend to schools and seminaries of every description; let all fare alike, the
white as well as the black. But let not the latter be visited with pains and
penalties while the former are exempt. As to the clamor which is raised about
the fanaticism of those who are friendly to the instruction of the blacks, or
the sneers and censures so liberally bestowed upon Miss Crandall, they cannot,
even if well founded, alter the character of the law. The correctness of their
view, and the expediency of their measures, are different questions from the
justice of the law by which it is proposed to counteract them. The indiscretion
of individuals, allowing them to exist, are no justification of a legal
enactment unequal, oppressive and wrong in its provisions, and at war with the
genius of our republican institutions. In some of the papers from the slave
states, the law as was to be expected, is commended; it is seen to be in
accordance with the rigorous measures adopted under a system of slavery—but in
other sections of our country, it is strongly condemned, and regarded as a shame

It is a very lame affair: much more so than we should have expected from a lawyer, aspiring to a seat in Congress. He does not even make a <em>plausible</em> defence. The very <em>plea</em> must insure <em>condemnation</em> among republicans. Miss Crandall’s school, according to Mr. Judson, is to be legislated down— <em>not</em> because colored people are not human beings—“created free and equal”—not because they are not entitled to education— <em>not</em> because the object is undesirable— <em>not</em> because Miss Crandall was incompetent to teach them— <em>not</em> because the town was in danger (as had been pretended) of being overrun with paupers, but because Miss Crandall is an <em>abolitionist!</em> A fine TEST ACT, truly! Why not because she is a Baptist? A large portion of the Baptists, and of other sects, we trust, are rapidly embracing the heresy against which “His Grace, the” [American] “Lord Bishop of Canterbury” has fulminated his papal bull. And so the abolitionists are legally disqualified from school teaching, are they? From what will they next be debarred? From preaching? From medical and from legal practice?

Much in the same vein of logic, Mr. Judson defends the <em>Connecticut</em> law, by remarking that schools might be established in <em>other</em> states!

<p>The morn of Adam’s happiness beamed on it—</p>
<p>A wife so lovely, babes so innocent,</p>
<p>That earth’s best blessings seemed to centre there.</p>
<p>I’ve seen the busy village, and the city,</p>
<p>Where gathered wealth finds by a thousand channels</p>
<p>New means to bless mankind. I’ve also seen,”</p>
<p>(And angry clouds, from up the west arising,</p>
<p>Proclaimed a tempest near,) “I’ve also seen</p>
<p>Much misery.—The armies joined in battle,</p>
<p>The shock, the falling ranks, the vict’ry won,</p>
<p>The battle field, where, satiate with the carnage,</p>
<p>Death’s dreadful angel had retired awhile.</p>
<p>The widow and the widow’s boy were there,</p>
<p>Searching, among the mangled flesh and bones,</p>
<p>For what they once had husband called, and father.</p>
<p>The frantic maid was there, whose blue eyes streamed</p>
<p>Love’s last but bitterest flood, while on the clay</p>
<p>That once had been her lover, she arranged</p>
<p>The vestment, taken from a neighb’ring corpse.</p>
<p>True, this was sad, but far more sad the sight</p>
<p>Of those who sought their friends among the living,</p>
<p>Where liquid death mocks at the play of battle.</p>
<p>I saw the more than widow seek her husband</p>
<p>Among the bacchanals: she found him out,</p>
<p>And said, ‘when will you come and visit us—</p>
<p>Your wife and daughter—for we have no bread.’</p>
<p>He turned and looked a look that froze her heart,</p>
<p>And then, relenting, offered her the glass</p>
<p>To cheer her spirits! I have also seen”—</p>
<p>(And on his face he drew a veil of clouds,</p>
<p>And in the rolling thunder told the story,)</p>
<p><em>“I’ve seen the manacled and wretched slave</em></p>
<p>Lie down to take his punishment: The scourge,</p>
<p>Made at the shop where Patience, wearied sat,</p>
<p>And told Invention how ti braid the thongs,</p>
<p>Was brandished in the air; The slave cried out,</p>
<p>
  ‘Good master spare, O! <em>am I not a man?</em>
</p>
<p>But cried in vain, the whip went gaily round</p>
<p>‘Till ‘forty stripes save one’ were fully told.</p>

<p>That nature prompted. O, stupendous mercy!</p>

<p>Her last remains of right.”</p>

<p>Beneath the troubled waves. The storm passed on,</p>
<p>And silence reigned, and heaven seemed to hold</p>
<p>A consultation on the affairs of men.</p>
<p>And gazing upward, at the bright expanse,</p>
<p>I heard a voice—“when that fair moon is turned</p>

<em>The Sin of Slavery, and its Remedy</em> 	<em>The Sin of Slavery, and its Remedy, containing some reflections on the moral influence of the American Colonization,"</em> New York: Published for the Author, 1832	Abolition	"<p>
  (We extract the following from Professor Wright’s pamphlet, entitled “The Sin
  of Slavery, and its Remedy.)
</p>
<p>
  The American revolution was incomplete. It left one sixth part of the
  population the victims of a servitude immeasurably more debasing, than that
  from which it delivered the rest. While this nation held up its declaration of
  independence—its noble bill of human rights, before an admiring world, in one
  hand; it mortified the friends of humanity, by oppressing the poor and
  defenceless with the other. The progress of time has not lessened the evil.
  There are now held in involuntary and perpetual slavery, in the southern half
  of this republic, more than 2,000,000 of men, women, and children, guarded
  with a vigilance, which strives, and with success appalling as it is complete,
  to shut out every ray of knowledge, human and divine, and reduce them as
  nearly as possible to a level with the brutes. These miserable slaves are not
  only compelled to labor without choice and without hire, but they are
  subjected to the cruelty and lust of their masters to an unbounded extent. In
  the northern states there is very generally a sympathy with the slave-holders,
  and a prejudice against the slaves, which shows itself in palliating the crime
  of slave-holding, and in most unrighteously disregarding the rights, and
  vilifying the characters of the free colored men.
</p>
<p>
  At the same time, slavery, as a system, is (in a certain sense) condemned. It
  is confessed to be a great evil, “a moral evil,” and, when the point is urged,
  <em>a sin.</em>
  The slaves, it is admitted, have rights—every principle of honesty, justice,
  and humanity,
  <em>“in the abstract,”</em>
  calls aloud that they should be made free. The word of God is in their favour.
  Indeed, there is no ground claimed by the abettors of slavery, on which they
  pretend to justify it for a moment, but a supposed—a begged—
  <em>expediency,</em>
  baseless as the driven clouds. I say baseless, for while not a single fact has
  ever been produced, going to show the danger of putting the slaves, all at
  once, under the protection of law, and employing them as free laborers, there
  have been produced, on the other side, varied and fair experiments showing,
  that it is altogether safe and profitable.
</p>
<p>
  In this state of things where had the American church stood? Has she too
  sympathized with the hearts of the Pharaohs? Or has she in the spirit of the
  martyrs of former times, borne an unflinching testimony against this sin?
  Alas! The painful truth stares us in the face. She has come down from the high
  and firm foundation of scripture truth, and is professedly at work upon a
  floating
  <em>expediency,</em>
  doing against slavery what can be done upon the checked current of popular
  prejudice.—Speaking through the organ of the Colonization Society, she has
  admitted all that the most determined slave-holder could ask, and she is doing
  just that, and no more, which so far as he understands the subject, he hails
  with pleasure as a safeguard to is property in human bodies and
  <em>souls.</em>
  This is the testimony of slave-holders themselves—most competent witnesses.
</p>
<p>
  Is further evidence needed? When the American Colonization Society, as a
  remedy for slavery, has been called in question, as well it might be for its
  tardiness, if for no other reason, there has been manifested a determination
  to hush inquiry. There has been a most pusillanimous shivering and shrinking
  from the probe. Nay, the few men who, in the uncompromising spirit of
  Christian benevolence, have urged this inquiry, have been slandered as
  disturbers of the public peace,—have been assailed with abusive epithets, not
  be slave-holders only, but by their brethren in the bosom of the church.
</p>
<p>
  A most singular spectacle is presented in this enlightened and Christian age;
  a handful of philanthropists, dare denounce a system of legalized oppression,
  and to charge guilt upon all who uphold it; upon this, not only do the
  principals in crime, as might be expected, ascribe the whole to sheer malice,
  but the leaders of the Christian church, as ought not to be expected, endorse,
  and give currency to the charge, and throw the whole weight of their cold and
  crushing influence to smother in its cradle this attempt at a gospel
  reformation.
</p>
<p>
  What does all this mean? Are Christians in these northern states interested in
  upholding slavery? Are they unwilling to be convinced that their colored
  brethren are better than the slanders of their oppressors would make them? Are
  they sure, beyond a doubt, that the colonization scheme will relieve our
  country of the mighty evil which is crushing it? that it is the
  <em>Christian</em>
  way to relieve it? Are they on good evidence convinced that it is not
  <em>expedient</em>
  to say to the wicked, “O wicked man, thou shalt surely die?” Must they have
  PEACE at any rate—peace, though the groans of millions should ascend and
  mingle with the muttering thunders of coming wrath? Will they have it, that if
  a word is said against a mere experiment to test the practicability of
  rescuing the victim by flattering the oppressor, the whole cause of Christian
  benevolence is attacked? If not, why not welcome inquiry? A thorough
  investigation—a looking on
  <em>both sides,</em>
  would surely do no harm. Those defenders of truth who have shunned such
  inquiry, have always proved themselves short-sighted. The cause of God courts
  scrutiny—its advocates are thrown into no unseemly agitation when they are
  most rigorously sifted.
</p>
<p>
  The subject cries aloud for more earnest consideration than it has yet
  received. More than two millions of outraged, downtrodden men cry out, shall
  we die in this sore bondage that white Christians may have the pleasure of
  attempting to shun God’s wrath without repenting of sin?—Half a million of
  free colored men cry out—America is our country—the land for which
  <em>our</em>
  fathers bled as well as yours. Why will you seek to banish us? The wrongs of
  the poor Indian cry aloud, There is no safety in league with transgressors!
  The present political aspect of the South cries out, that tyrants do not
  regard law! Six hundred millions of idolaters cry out to the American church,
  “Why pluckest thou the mote out of thy brother’s eye, and behold a beam is in
  thine own!”

Rivers	We, the People	Nature	"<p>
  RIVERS.—There is a wonderous beauty, a mysterious charm, in flowing
  waters.—Seldom does painter, poet, or novelist, attempt to sketch a scene of
  surpassing loveliness, but a “smooth stream,” a “murmuring rivulet,” or a
  “tumbling cascade,” forms a prominent feature in the glowing landscape. Their
  fair images of human perfection, must chaunt their joys to “babbling
  brooks”—must sigh out their griefs to an accompaniment of aquatic melody, and
  “mingle their tears with the torrents as they fall.”
</p>
<p>
  Nor do rivers appear by any means contemptible in the pages of the historian.
  Who has not heard the fame of the Nile, that source of Egypt, prosperity, and
  that proverbial emblem of a truly benevolent man? As signs the poet,
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Bounteous
  as the Nile’s dark waters,
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  “Undiscovered as their spring.”
</p>
<p>
  And who has not read of the Jordan, which beheld the course and fled backward
  at the approach of Jehovah’s chosen tribes? Of the Granicus, where the world’s
  conqueror first met and scattered the countless hosts of Persia? Of the cold
  Cydnus, which had well nigh checked the rash victor’s headlong career? Of the
  sacred Ganges, whose waters cleanse from moral pollution? Of the yellow Tiber,
  that laves the walls of the Eternal City? Of the Rubicon, where the aspiring
  Roman decided between his ambition and the better feelings of his heart, and
  threw the torch of civil war among the combustible materials of the old
  world’s proudest empire?
</p>
<p>
  The traveler who visits lands renowned in ancient story, finds nothing in the
  relics of their former grandeur, better fitted to impress the mind with that
  sensation of pleasing sadness which memorials of other days call up, than the
  broad streams, {unreadable due to a fold} reflected tower, palace, and temple,
  glittering in the sunbeams, and whose shores echoed to the ceaseless hum of a
  crowded city’s busy population, where now, solitude, desolation, and silence,
  reign amid the fallen arches, the broken columns, and the mouldering ruins of
  structures which the vain architect of former days reared in ponderous and
  massy strength, as if defying the destroyer Time. How forcibly is he impressed
  with the vanity of human greatness, as he surveys the quiet stream, rolling on
  its channel, heedless of the desolation around, unchanged by the mighty
  revolutions that have swept from the face of day, cities, states, and
  empires—regardless alike of chieftains, kings, and conquerors, who once dyed
  its waves with the purple tide of slaughter, or received on its banks the
  homage of conquered millions, and of the slaves who basely bowed the knee in
  servile adoration, to the mortal god. The noble Tigris still holds its onward
  course, unaltered since the haughty walls of Nineveh overhung its banks, and
  her six score thousand inhabitants who knew not the right hand from the left,
  listened to the prophet of the Lord warning them of speedy destruction. The
  famed Euphrates ceases not to flow, though the “queen of cities” is a desert
  waste, and long ages have elapsed since Chaldea heard the voice of wailing and
  the loud lament, “Babylon is fallen, is fallen.” Xanthus and Scamander still
  water the plains of Asia Minor, though the towers of Priam have crumbled into
  dust, and the bright glory of Ilium has vanished like a vision of the night.
</p>
<p>
  And when the grave in its silence and its gloom shall have closed over all of
  life and activity the earth now contains; when the grand and beautiful works
  of art which we behold, shall be as the magnificence of Babylon or of Troy;
  when we shall have taken up our abode in the cold chambers of darkness, “and
  the places that now know us shall know us no more;” when our names shall fall
  on the listener’s ear like the faint echo of a distant voice, or the dim
  recollections of a half forgotten dream; when the finger of decay shall have
  erased the records of our achievements, and our deeds shall be remembered as
  the traditionary legends of antiquity; when the generations that succeed us
  shall have faded from the earth like the passing shadow of a thin and fleecy
  cloud; the lovely streams by which we delight to rove, will still wind through
  the vallies [sic], diffusing verdure and fertility in their path; the cataract
  will still leap “in thunder and in foam,” from the rocky brow of the
  precipice, sending up its sparkling spray to glitter in the dazzling
  sun-light, and to crown its front with a halo of varying and respondent hues;
  the calm and stately current of the might river will still sweep on in majesty
  to the ocean, shaded perhaps by the thick boughs of the giant oak or gloomy
  pine, and fringed with shrubs and blooming wild flowers, where
  <em>we</em>
  behold reflected in its pellucid mirror, the spire of the village church, and
  the thickly crowded habitations of men; and where now it visits but the forest
  haunts of roving savages and beasts of prey, or glides through glens untrod by
  human footsteps, and undisturbed by voice or sound, save the ripple of the
  waters below &amp; the rustle of leaf and branch above, shall then be seen the
  snow-white sail wafting along its tranquil tide the rich product of
  agricultural industry and commercial enterprise.
</p>
<p>
  A new race shall have risen to possess the heritage of their fathers, to walk
  among the ruins of our splendid edifices, to gaze on the streams that we
  admire, and while they gaze, to muse as we do now, and as hundreds before us
  have done, on the fleeting evanescence of earthly fame, and the shadowy
  illusiveness of human grandeur.

  information on the Statute, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>Prudence Crandall</p>
<p>
  Miss Crandall was originally brought before Rufus Adams, Esq. a Justice of the
  Peace for Windham County, by a warrant issued by him on a complaint by the
  Grand Juror of the town of Canterbury, charging her with violating a statute
  law of the State of Connecticut passed at the last session of the Legislature
  in regard to teaching, boarding, harboring, &amp;c. persons of color, not
  inhabitants of the State. She entered a demurrer to the complaint, the Court
  judged the complaint sufficient and thereupon ordered Miss Crandall to give
  bond with surety in the sum of $150, for her appearance before the next County
  Court to be tried on said complaint, and abide the judgment of said Court
  thereon. Failing to procure bonds, she was committed to prison. The cause came
  on for trial before the County Court on Friday, August 23d: C.F. Cleaveland,
  Esq. the Attorney for the State, being absent from indisposition, the Court
  appointed Jonathan A. Welch, Esq. special attorney to conduct the prosecution.
  A.T. Judson and I. Bulkley, Esqrs. were associate counsel.&nbsp; Hon. Calvin
  Goddard, Hon. W. W. Ellsworth and Henry Strong, Esq. appeared for the defence.
  The jury being empannelled and sworn, the counsel for the defence objected to
  one of the jurors from Canterbury on the ground that he had signed petitions,
  &amp;c. in respect to Miss Crandall’s school, and taken active measures to put
  it down. The Court sustained the objection, and the juror was excused. They
  also objected to another of the jurors on the ground that he was a member of
  the Legislature which passed the law, was one of those who voted for it, and
  had, of course, formed an opinion with respect to its constitutionality. The
  Court decided that the juror was competent to sit. (He got excused, however,
  on account of sickness.) The information against Miss Crandall consisted of
  two counts. The first charged “that the said Prudence Crandall, on the 24
  <sup>th</sup>
  day of June last, with force, and arms, in a certain school which before that
  time had been and then was set up in said Canterbury, for the instruction and
  teaching of colored persons, to wit: Theodosia De Grasse, Ann Peterson, Amelia
  Elizabeth Wilder, Ann Eliza Hammond, and others whose names are unknown, who
  at the time so taught and instructed were not inhabitants of any town in this
  state, which said acts were done, by the said Prudence Crandall, without the
  consent, in writing, first had and obtained of a majority of the civil
  authority and select men of the said town of Canterbury, within which said
  school was then instructed, against the peace of this state, and contrary to
  the form and effect of the statute in such case made and provided.”
</p>
<p>
  The second count charged “that the defendant, with force and arms did wilfully
  and knowingly harbor and board, and aid and assist in harboring and boarding
  certain colored persons (named above,) who, when so harbored and boarded, were
  not inhabitants of any town in this State—without the consent in writing of
  the civil authority and select men, &amp;c.”
</p>
<p>Plea, Not Guilty.</p>
<p>The following witnesses were then called on the part of the prosecution.</p>
<p>
  <em>Asahel Bacon</em>
  said that he had called at Miss Crandall’s house in the month of June last,
  having heard that she had taken some scholars from abroad. Capt. Sanger
  accompanied him. They were both select men of the town. Miss Crandall invited
  them into her house very politely. They asked her in relation to her scholars.
  She said she had four who were from New York and one from Hartford.—She called
  them in and introduced them. Theodosia De Grass, Amelia Elizabeth Wildes, and
  Catherine Ann Weldon, he thinks were the names of those called. Witness did
  not remember the day of the month that he called—thinks it was the day after
  the girls came—certainly soon after.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Ebenezer Sanger</em>
  coincided in the statement of Mr. Bacon.
</p>
<p>
  <em>George Cady</em>
  had conversed with Miss Crandall—went to her house on Friday last to summon as
  witnesses to support this prosecution, some of the girls who were attending
  the school. One of those named in this subpoena said that she had been sent
  for him, on account of the sickness of her mother, and wished him to excuse
  her attendance at Court—told her that he could not, but would state the
  circumstances to the public prosecutor. Miss Crandall said that she did not
  see that there was any need of witnesses at all, for she should confess that
  she had broken the law.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Ann Peterson,</em>
  This witness was a colored girl, said to be a pupil of Miss Crandall, and was
  one of those named in the information to whom Miss C. had given instruction.
  Mr. Ellsworth objected to the examination of the witness on the ground that
  she could not testify without implicating herself. Mr. Welch read the clause
  of the statute under which this prosecution was sustained, in which it was
  enacted that the pupils in a school kept contrary to the act, might be
  compelled to testify. Mr. Ellsworth said that he denied, altogether, the
  competency of the Legislature to compel a witness to testify, or answer
  questions that might implicate him, even to render himself liable in
  debt—otherwise a witness might be compelled to testify to what would charge
  him with the crime of murder. He alluded to the State Constitution and Bill of
  Rights which he claimed protected every person from criminating himself by
  being compelled to give testimony. It was contrary to fundamental principles.
  In this case the witness might make herself an aider and abettor, and subject
  herself to the penalties imposed by the statute. Mr. Judson claimed that the
  witness would not by her testimony implicate herself. The law was penal, and
  must be construed strictly. Even if she was aware that she was instructed by
  Miss Crandall, it would not charge herself with any crime. Mr. Judson read at
  length from Starkie on evidence, to show that the witness ought, on common law
  principles, to be examined, and was bound to answer questions as to what she
  knew of Miss C.’s school. At all events he claimed that, in this instance,
  such must be the case as the Legislature had expressly enacted that the pupils
  should be witnesses. Mr. Ellsworth, in reply, said he apprehended the question
  to be whether the Legislature possessed the power to compel a witness to
  convict himself. He read from the opinion of Chief Justice Hosmer, in the 8
  <sup>th</sup>
  Con. Rep. and also from the case of the people vs. Mather, in 4
  <sup>th</sup>
  Wendell’s Reps on the subject of examining witnesses.&nbsp; By the principles
  decided these cases, which were the settled law of the land, he claimed that
  the witness was not compelled to answer any questions in relation to her
  knowledge of this school. The Court decided that the witness, under the
  circumstances, was not protected, but must be examined.—The examination was
  about to proceed, when Mr. Ellsworth rose and stated to the Court that the
  witness had been advised not to answer interrogatories in regard to her
  knowledge of this school. He felt it to be his duty now to repeat this advice.
  He wished the Court, however, distinctly to understand that the counsel for
  the accused had taken this course not with a view to embarrass the trial, but
  solely from a sense of duty. He conscientiously believed that the legal rights
  of the witness were such that she should not be compelled to testify. The
  Counsel for the prosecution, asked the witness when she came to Canterbury,
  but she declined answering the question. A number of other questions were then
  proposed to the witness, the principal of which were—“Has Miss Crandall kept a
  school for colored girls not inhabitants of this state?”—“Will you say whether
  the defendant has or has not instructed any person of color other than
  yourself since the 10
  <sup>th</sup>
  of June last, or boarded and instructed colored persons not inhabitants of
  this state?” To all these and other questions of a similar character, the
  witness decline giving an answer, on the ground that she could not do so
  without criminating herself. The counsel for the prosecution then called
  <em>Catherine Ann Weldon</em>
  and
  <em>Eliza Hammond,</em>
  both girls of color, and charged with being pupils of Miss Crandall, and
  propounded to them the same questions as above; but they for the same reason,
  and by the advice of counsel, declined answering. The prosecuting Attorney
  reserved to himself, though he waived for the present, the right of moving for
  an order that these witnesses be committed for a contempt of court.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Jacob C. Gould</em>
  said he was acquainted with Ann Eliza Hammond. She belonged to Providence R.I.
  had known her since she was a child—was the daughter of Thomas Hammond, who
  died in 1826. Her mother now lived in Providence—the father at his death was
  worth from 1500 to $2000 in real estate.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Levi Kneeland,</em>
  Was not connected with Miss Crandall’s school except as an adviser in relation
  to it—was pastor of the Church to which Miss Crandall belonged—had seen
  several of the colored girls who were present at his church during the summer.
  In reply to a question whether he had seen one of the girls elsewhere than at
  his church declined answering. In reply to the question whether he had not
  seen one of them at Miss Crandall’s, declined answering—decline to answer
  whether he had advised Miss Crandall in relation to her school. Declined
  answering whether or not he had been in Miss Crandall’s school since the 10
  <sup>th</sup>
  of June last. The court, having decided that he was bound to answer the
  questions put to him, and that the reasons he offered for refusing to do so,
  namely, that he might subject himself to a prosecution, and entangle himself
  in difficulties, were insufficient, granted a motion for a mittimus to commit
  him to prison and he was taken into custody by the Sheriff.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Eliza Parkis</em>
  (a woman of color) was acquainted with Ann Eliza Hammond, one of the girls
  that Miss Crandall was charged with having instructed. Has seen her in
  Providence—has also seen her at Miss Crandall’s, and slept in a room with Miss
  De Grasse a colored girl from New York. Miss Crandall employed witness to work
  for her, because she said she did not wish to keep her scholars out of school
  to do the work. Never saw any of the girls in school.—Have seen them have
  books and study them.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Rowland Greene</em>
  (affirmed) Has often heard that Miss Crandall kept a school for colored girls
  in Canterbury—has been at the house often, was called as a physician—went
  there and saw several colored girls—heard some of them recite in grammar,
  geography, &amp;c. Some of the girls has been at his own house. Has seen a
  little girl there, said to be from New York—has heard Miss Crandall talk
  concerning her scholars from abroad—does not recollect to have heard her say
  that they were from New York.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Mr. Kneeland</em>
  was not placed at the bar by the Sheriff at his request, and said he intended
  no disrespect to the Court by declining to answer the interrogatories put to
  him, and being advised that he should not implicate himself by doing so, he
  was ready to answer. He proceeded to state that he had visited Miss Crandall’s
  school twice. Once it was under the charge of another person. He had prayed in
  the school and conversed with the girls on religious subjects—does not
  remember faces as well as people in general—could not therefore positively
  identify any one of those present as being the ones seen at Miss
  Crandall’s—should think they were—his best belief on the subject would be a
  guess—has taken meals at Miss Crandall’s and eaten with her pupils—has heard
  them recite their lessons—thinks he has heard Miss Hammond spoken of either by
  the defendant or her sister. Miss Crandall has conversed with him in relation
  to her scholars—thinks she has told him that some of them were from New York,
  and some from Providence and New-Haven.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Albert Hinckley,</em>
  has been at Miss Crandall’s several times since the month of June last—does
  not know whether he has been in her school room as he knows not in which room
  it is kept, has not conversed with her on the subject of the residence of her
  scholars—called on her as a friend and conversed on various topics—has heard
  that she kept a school for colored persons—has heard her speak of her scholars
  and school—has seen colored ladies at her house and has taken tea with
  them—cannot say whether any of those present were the ones or not.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Eliza Glasko,</em>
  This witness was a colored girl belonging to the school but an inhabitant of
  this state. The same objection was made to examining her as was before made in
  respect to the others, but the objection was overruled by the Court. She
  however declined answering the questions propounded to her. The prosecuting
  attorney moved the court for a mittimus to commit the witness for contempt of
  court. The court granted the motion and ordered the clerk to make out a
  mittimus.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Hezekiah Crandall,</em>
  (affirmed) His sister Prudence keeps a school at Canterbury for colored
  girls—knows Ann Eliza Hammond—could not certainly recognize any other that was
  present except perhaps Ann Peterson—has never been in the school nor heard the
  pupils recite—has seen Ann Eliza Hammond at his sisters, often, during June
  and July,—supposed she boarded there and was instructed by his sisters with
  others—knows by sight and name Amelia Wildes—does not know where she is
  now—has not heard his sister say any thing on the subject of her school for
  some time—she has resided in Canterbury some portion of the time for twelve
  years past.
</p>
<p>
  <em>James Chandler</em>
  said he was at Miss Crandall’s several times last spring (not being able to
  say with certainty whether he had been there since the passage of the law he
  was not interrogated farther.)
</p>
<p>
  <em>George Roberts</em>
  went to Miss Crandall’s about five months ag and carried a colored girl, Miss
  Hammond to the school—Miss Hammond it was said belonged to Providence, has
  been at Miss C’s since that time perhaps within ten weeks and drank tea—he
  then saw Miss Hammond but does not know whether she boarded there constantly
  or not—he heard her and other colored girls recite in Miss Crandall’s
  school—should think this was two or three months ago—has been at Miss C’s
  within a week but did not as he remembers see any of the girls present there
  at that time.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Mary Benson</em>
  (affirmed) Has been at Miss Crandall’s school and found it very
  interesting—was never present but for a short time—‘tis for colored
  persons—saw Ann Eliza Hammond there—she is one of the scholars and boards with
  Miss C.—Witness recognized several of those present as among the number she
  had seen at Miss Crandall’s—one of the pupils, Ann Weldon was from
  New-York—Miss Hammond was from Providence—witness was at Miss Crandall’s five
  weeks since and took tea—several colored girls were at the table—does not know
  where any of them belonged except by report—visited the school when it was
  near closing and heard Miss C. give the girls instruction in Geography and
  Arithmetic. The prosecuting Attorney here rested his evidence, and the sheriff
  having served his process on Eliza Glasko was about committing her to prison,
  when Mr. Ellsworth interposed and stated to the court that rather than have
  the girl committed he should advise her to testify—again repeating that the
  course of the defendant’s counsel in relation to the testimony of these girls,
  was dictated by an imperious sense of professional duty.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Eliza Glasko</em>
  the proceeded to give testimony. She said she was a member of Miss C’s school,
  and that the other girls near her were also members—one of them from
  Providence, the other said to be from New-York—the ordinary branches were
  taught them by Miss C.—reading, writing, grammar, geography, &amp;c., witness
  begun to go on the first of April—the school was usually opened and closed
  with prayer—the scriptures were read and explained daily in the school—some
  portions were committed to memory by the pupils and considered a part of their
  education.
</p>
<p>Mr. Judson then opened the case on the part of the prosecution.</p>
<p>
  He first stated the case and read the Act of the Legislature which he claimed
  that Miss Crandall had violated. He said that this act did not prevent any
  black from attending the district schools in the State, or any higher
  schools—that they had all the benefits of the school fund, and might attend the
  academies, high schools, or colleges, and that too whether they were citizens
  of this state, of other states, or of any part of the world. The sole
  intention and provision of the act was, that colored persons, from another
  jurisdiction, should not be intruded into any town in this state, without a
  written permission from the select men and civil authority of the town in
  which they proposed to reside. This was all, and this was perfectly lawful.
  The whole tenor and effect of the law was to place a school for colored
  persons under the care and supervision of the select men and civil authority
  of each town. He should ask the attention of the Court to the face that the
  Legislature had exercised a controlling power over schools within the limits
  of the state since 1717. (Mr. Judson here read from an old edition of the
  statutes, in respect to the power which the Legislature had exercised over
  schools in respect to preventing disorders and the application of the public
  money.)—These said Mr. Judson, were schools for the instruction of all
  classes, and the acts which he had read, showed that the Legislature thought
  proper to exercise care over these schools. Such was the ancient policy of the
  state, and this new law was no change of policy. The state owed its present
  honors, its present glories, to pursuing this policy of keepings its schools
  under a supervising power. Nor was there anything in the Constitution of the
  United States to prevent it. Towns, he claimed, had a right to say who should
  be allowed to become inhabitants by residence in their limits and this law
  gave them no more power than was necessary for the exercise of that right.
  That the law was illiberal and reflected disgrace on the State, on the
  Legislature which enacted it, he denied. On the contrary, said Mr. J., there
  are now more than 1500 schools in the state, supported by our fund of
  $1,800,000, to which blacks may go without the payment of a cent. Small as the
  state was, smaller than single counties in some other states, these facts were
  true concerning it. For himself he was proud of it. Where could a parallel be
  found in the universe?
</p>
<p>
  Public policy, continued Mr. J., absolutely demands that a law of this
  description should be maintained. It was claimed to be unconstitutional
  because exclusive in its operation on a particular class. Other laws of the
  state were liable to the same objection. Physicians and lawyers were instances
  of the operation of our exclusive law. Tanners, Taverners, Surveyors, &amp;c.
  must all be licensed. Manufactories were liable to be visited by the select
  men and civil authority for the purpose of seeing that the children employed
  in them were properly educated. If persons came here from other states and set
  up manufacturing establishments they were equally liable to be visited in this
  way though no such provisions existed in the laws of the states from whence
  they come. Lawyers in this state could not purchase choses [sic] in action. All
  these laws, with many similar ones, were passed in derogation of rights
  originally common to all; public policy however, required the enactment of
  them, as it did of the one in question, and in his opinion they all stood on
  similar grounds, and were, without question, in accordance with the
  Constitution.
</p>
<p>
  Mr. J. next referred to the course which other states had pursued in
  legislating on the subject of the blacks. He remarked on the law of Ohio. Our
  law is not, said Mr. J., an act of exclusion, nor an act of prohibition. It
  does not pretend to send away those who belong here, nor does it prohibit any
  from coming, but only makes it necessary that permission be first obtained.
  The laws of Georgia and North Carolina went so far as to authorise the
  imprisonment of blacks who came within their limits, even though they came in
  the capacity of cooks and stewards of vessels. In Tennessee blacks could not
  come from other states and remain within the state above twelve days without
  incurring penalties. In Maryland a man could not manumit his slave without his
  leaving the state. Even in Pennsylvania, “the land of Penn,” no free negro
  could remain without giving bonds for his support. All these laws Mr. J.
  claimed to be obnoxious to equal and indeed to greater constitutional
  objections than the one in question. The article in the constitution of the
  United States with which this law was supposed to conflict, he understood to
  be, the 2d section of the 4
  <sup>th</sup>
  article:—“The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all the privileges
  and immunities of citizens in the several states.” Mr. J. claimed that the
  term “citizens” in this place, and throughout the constitution, had a
  technical signification—a legal meaning—that it did not include colored
  persons—that they were not be the constitution recognized as citizens. A
  certain class of colored persons, (slaves) were in it considered as property.
</p>
<p>
  Mr. J. here referred to the laws of the United State on the subject of
  naturalization, reading from Ingersoll’s Digest, the several acts of Congress,
  and insisted that from them all, the language being precise, technical, and
  certain, none other than white persons could be naturalized citizens of the
  United States. He also read from the 2
  <sup>nd</sup>
  Kent’s Com. 70, 71, 72, by which he further illustrated these views.
</p>
<p>
  There have been, continued Mr. J., concurrent acts of the State of Connecticut
  which give the same construction to the constitution. If “citizen” do not mean
  a white person only—if it be claimed that a black is a citizen, then is the
  constitution of our own State a nullity, for it allows “free white males”
  alone to be electors. The privilege of being a freeman, he claimed, to be a
  higher one that the right of being educated. Why should a man be educated who
  could not be a freeman? A person who pays a single cent State tax, or who does
  military duty, is entitled to the privilege of voting. In Massachusetts these
  qualifications were not sufficient. Each state in the Union has these local
  laws and customs peculiar to itself—these must all be abrogated at a blow, by
  deciding the law in question to be unconstitutional. Full effect however,
  might be given to the clause in the constitution, referred to without
  producing this result, and that was, by construing the term “citizen” in the
  manner he had before pointed out.
</p>
<p>
  The first act in our own statute would be nullified by a decision that this
  law was unconstitutional—a citizen of another State cannot maintain an action
  in our courts for any cause unless a substantial inhabitant of the State give
  bond for him. No one has doubted the constitutionality of this law, and the
  law in question, with respect to constitutionality, could not be distinguished
  from it.
</p>
<p>
  Mr. J. said he should conclude his remarks on this subject by alluding merely
  to one other argument in support of this law, and that was, that the public
  safety of this State, the preservation of its true interests, required this
  law to be enforced. The southern States might emancipate their slaves and send
  them all to Connecticut instead of Liberia. The influx of that species of
  population might be so great as to be overwhelming. (Mr. J. proceeded to
  remark on the effect which recent measures of the British Parliament, on the
  subject of slavery, might have on this question, when he was interrupted by
  the court, who remarked that tho’ far from inclined to restrain all the limits
  of the discussion, yet it did not seem pertinent to the issue to argue the
  policy or expediency of the laws. Mr. J. said he would not press the point.)
  Mr. J. hoped that he had not been misunderstood in the remarks he had made. He
  wished not to oppress any class of population. He heartily wished that every
  slave might be emancipated that every day. But if it could not be done without
  destruction to our constitutions, and desolating our land, he could not desire
  it.
</p>
<p>
  He would only add to the Jury that though it was true they were at liberty to
  consider what the court said to them on the subject of the law, as advice,
  still he hoped they would pay it such respect as advice from the bench was
  properly entitled to. A single word as to the facts. The information charged
  the defendant with boarding and instructing, in different counts. It was
  sufficient if they found her guilty on either. The day was immaterial. If they
  found her guilty of doing the act charged on any day, since the passage of the
  law, and before the filing of the information, ‘twas sufficient. It was not
  necessary that they should find that she had boarded or instructed each of the
  persons named in the information; to instruct or board one was a transgression
  of the law.
</p>
<p>As to the proof it was abundant, conclusive.</p>
<p>
  Mr. Ellsworth, after stating the case, and remarking on the prohibitions of
  the law, said that he proposed not to occupy time in relation to the facts of
  the case. He would willingly have advised the pupils of Miss Crandall to have
  testified had he not believed that in so doing they voluntarily surrendered
  their most sacred rights. True it was, the defendant has kept this
  school—‘twas no secret, and whether that constituted a crime or not was for
  the jury to determine. In order to convict my client, said Mr. E., you
  gentlemen, must find on your oaths that she had committed a crime. You may
  find that she has violated an act of the State Legislature, but if you also
  find her protected by a higher power, it will be your duty to acquit. The
  court he was fully assured, would charge the jury that the law was
  unconstitutional, if they so believed, but after all, it belonged to the people
  to determine whether one of them had been guilty of a crime. Each one of the
  jury must be satisfied for himself alone, that a crime has been committed. He
  flattered himself that he should be able to lead them to the conclusion that
  the law in question was a violation of the constitution of this State and of
  the United States. The constitution of the United States was the highest power
  known in our land. Beyond that, no Legislature can go and if the jury find the
  law not to stand well with the constitution they must say so.
</p>
<p>
  The real question for the jury to settle Mr. Ellsworth apprehended to be this:
  Can the Legislature of Connecticut pass a law prohibiting the citizens of
  other States from coming into this State, and there residing, to
  prosecute the acquisition of knowledge, in a way open to the citizens of this
  State. This he believed was the precise question, and it reached deep and
  wide—wider and deeper than was perhaps imagined. It was however claimed by his
  friend from Canterbury, that colored persons were not citizens, and that the
  provisions of the constitution, with respect to citizens of the United States,
  did not apply to this class of our population. The criterion of citizenship
  was complexion in the view of the gentleman who had preceded him. I, said Mr.
  E., make the criterion to be either birth or naturalization. Admitting that
  none but white persons can be naturalized, it does not touch the question of
  citizenship by birth. Is it so that a person born on our soil, is not a
  citizen of our soil? In the days of Revolution, said Mr. E., these men fought
  side by side with our fathers, and shed their blood for their country—the
  country to which they owed indefeasible allegiance. Their names were now
  inscribed on the Pension Rolls of the Government—they now received the
  honorable trophies of the services they had rendered. Where, said Mr. E., does
  the gentleman get the doctrine that the rights of man, as a citizen, depend
  upon his color? A colored man could appeal to the laws for the protection of
  his rights in every State could he, if he were not a citizen? (Mr. E. here read
  a few sentences from the commencement of the declaration of independence,
  which, he said, according to the argument of the gentleman opposed to him,
  ought to be changed so as to have the words “except black people” introduced
  between each clause,) Mr. E. said he was a republican, he claimed to be as
  much a republican as his friend from Canterbury, and he hoped that his friend
  was not so ashamed of his republicanism, as to wish this instrument, the
  Declaration of Independence, interpolated in this manner. Our own
  constitution, continued Mr. E., recognized, in express terms, equality of
  rights—that men were equal in rights, but to this the gentleman would add
  “except black men.” He hoped he should not live long enough to see such
  doctrine go forth from Connecticut. The free colored population has, and is
  justly entitled, to equal representation in the Congress of the United States
  with the white population. Could not a black man commit treason? The gentleman
  would have it that he could not, for none other than citizens can. (Mr. E.
  here read from the 2
  <sup>nd</sup>
  Kent’s Com on the subject of citizenship, by birth.) I scout the idea, said
  Mr. E., that a man, born here by the side of me, is not a citizen because, his
  father was black, while I am a citizen because mine was white.

Dreadful Effects of Immediate Emancipation	The Unionist	Abolition; Haiti	"<p align=""center"">DREADFUL EFFECTS OF IMMEDIATE EMANCIPATION</p>
<p align=""center"">[From a pamphlet recently published in England.}</p>
<p>
  Of the many persons who declare themselves averse to slavery and yet afraid to
  join in measures for its abolition, some perhaps have not paid much attention
  to the instances of emancipation that have already taken place. If any such
  will take the trouble to read the following account of the effects of
  emancipation as far as it has hitherto been tried, they will perhaps see that
  their fears on the subject are not justified by experience.
</p>
<p>
  The History of Hayti when separated from the accidental circumstances
  attending it, furnishes irrefragable evidence of the safety and advantage of
  immediate emancipation. It is true that much blood was shed there during the
  French revolution; but this was not owing to the emancipation of the slaves,
  but was the consequence either of the civil war which preceded the act of
  emancipation; or of the atrocious attempt to restore slavery.
</p>
<p>
  In September, 1793, Polvirel, one of the Commissioners sent to St. Domingo by
  the National Convention, issues a proclamation declaring the whole of the
  slaves in the island free. Colonel Malenfant, a slave proprietor, resident at
  the time in the island, thus describes the effects of this sudden measure.
  “After this public act of emancipation, the Negroes remained quiet both in the
  south and in the west, and they continued to work upon all the plantations.
  There were estates which had neither owners nor managers resident upon them,
  and on those estates where no white men were left to direct them, they betook
  themselves to the planting of provisions; but upon all plantations where the
  whites resided, the blacks continued to labor as quietly as before.” Colonel
  Malenfant says, that when many of his neighbors, proprietors or managers, were
  in prison, the negroes of their plantations came to him to beg him to direct
  them in their work. “If you will take care not to talk to them of the
  restoration of slavery, but talk to them of freedom, you may with this word
  chain them down to their labor. How did Toussaint succeed?—How did I succeed
  before is time in the plain of the Culde-Sac on the plantation Gourand, during
  more than eight months after liberty had been granted to the slaves? Let those
  who knew me at that time, let the blacks themselves, be asked: they will all
  reply that not a single negro upon that plantation, consisting of more than
  four hundred and fifty laborers, refused to work: and yet this plantation was
  thought to be under the worst discipline and the slaves the most idle of any
  in the plain. I inspired the same activity into three other plantations of
  which I had the management. If all the negroes had come from Africa within six
  months, if they had the love of independence that the Indians have, I should
  own that force must be employed; but ninety-nine out of a hundred of the
  blacks are aware that without labor they cannot procure the things that are
  necessary for them; that there is no other method of satisfying their wants
  and their tastes. They know that they must work; the wish to do so, and they
  will do so.”
</p>
<p>
  Such was the conduct of the negroes for the first nine months after their
  liberation, or up to the middle of 1794. In the latter part of 1796, Malenfant
  says, “The colony was flourishing under Toussaint, the whites lived happily
  and in peace upon their estates, and the negroes continued to work for them”
  General Lecroix who published his “Memoirs for a history of St. Domingo” in
  1819, says that in 1797 the most wonderful progress had been made in
  agriculture. “The Colony,” said he, “marched as by enchantment towards its
  ancient splendor: cultivation prospered; every day produced perceptible proof
  of its progress.” General Vincent, who was a general of brigade of artillery
  in St. Domingo and a proprietor of estates in the island, was sent by
  Toussaint to Paris in 1801 to lay before the Directory the new constitution
  which had been agreed upon in St. Domingo. He arrived in France just at the
  moment of the peace of Amiens, and found that Bonaparte was preparing an
  armament for the purpose of restoring slavery in St. Domingo. He remonstrated
  against the expedition; he stated that it was totally unnecessary and
  therefore criminal, for that every thing was going on well in St. Domingo. The
  proprietors were in peaceable possessions of their estates; cultivation was
  making rapid progress; the blacks were industrious and beyond example happy.
  He conjured him, therefore not to reverse this beautiful state of things, but
  his efforts were ineffectual, and the expedition arrived upon the shores of
  St. Domingo. At length, however, the French were driven from the island. Till
  that time the planters had retained their property, and then it was, and not
  till then, that they lost their all. In 1804 Dessalines was proclaimed
  Emperor; in process of time a great part of the black troops were disbanded,
  and returned to cultivation again. From that time to this, there has been no
  want of subordination or industry among them.
</p>
<p>
  The following account of the character and condition of the negroes of Hayti,
  at a later period, is taken from “Sketches of Hayti” by Mr. Harvey, who during
  the latter part of the reign of Christophe spent a considerable time at Cape
  François the capital of his dominions. “The cultivators who formed the great
  mass of the population, resided on or near the plantations of which they were
  appointed to labor. A great proportion of them were engaged in cultivating the
  estates of the king; if soldiers, they were fed and clothed at his expense; if
  regular cultivators, they received such a share of the produce as was fully
  adequate to yield them a competent maintenance. Others were in the employ of
  the nobles and officers, who received either stated wages or such a portion of
  the article they cultivated as was deemed a sufficient reward for their
  industry, were equally supplied with whatever could contribute to their
  comfort. And those who by their exertions and economy were enabled to procure
  small spots of land of their own or to hold the smaller plantations at an
  annual rent, were diligently engaged in cultivating coffee, sugar, and other
  articles, which they disposed of to the inhabitants of the adjacent towns and
  villages. It was an interesting sight to behold this class of the Haytians, now
  in possession of their freedom, coming in groups to the market nearest which
  they resided, bringing the produce of their industry for sale; and afterwards
  returning, carrying back the necessary articles of living which the disposal
  of their commodities had enabled them to purchase; all evidently cheerful and
  happy. Nor could it fail to occur to the mind that their present condition
  furnished the most satisfactory answer to that objection to the general
  emancipation of slaves, founded on their alleged unfitness to value and
  improve the benefits of liberty.
</p>
<p>
  Though of the same race and possessing the same general traits of character as
  the negroes of the other West India islands, they are already distinguished
  from them by habits of industry and activity such as slaves are seldom known
  to exhibit. As they would not suffer, so they do not require the attendance of
  one acting in the capacity of a driver with the instrument of punishment in
  his hand.—As far as I had an opportunity of ascertaining from what fell under
  my own observation, and from what I gathered from other European residents, I
  am persuaded of one general fact which on account of its importance I shall
  state in the most explicit terms, viz: that the Haytians employed in
  cultivating the plantations, as well as the rest of the population, perform as
  much work in a given time as they were accustomed to do during their
  subjection to the French. And if we may judge of their future improvement by
  the change which has already effected, it may be reasonably anticipated that
  Hayti will ere long contain a population not inferior in their industry to
  that of any civilized nation in the world.
</p>
<p>
  While the interior of this island was in this improving state, and its
  inhabitants were peaceful and industrious, Cape Francois and other towns
  presented scenes of the utmost order and activity: the great majority of the
  inhabitants of Cape Francois consisted of trades-people and mechanics, the
  former of whom were supplied by the resident merchants with cloths, linens,
  silks and other manufactures, which they sold to the natives in small
  quantities. Their business was seldom so great as to enable them to amass
  fortunes, but it afforded them ample means of support. Towards strangers who
  entered their shops, whether for the purpose of making purchases or not, they
  were invariably and remarkably civil; a trait in the character of Christophe’s
  subjects which I believe to have been universal. The mechanics, though many of
  them were deficient in skill from having been imperfectly instructed, were all
  enabled by their industry to gain a competent maintenance. On the whole, the
  scene which Cape Francois presented was as interesting as it was in many
  respects surprising. In few places of commerce could there be seen greater
  regularity in the despatch [sic] of business, greater diligence displayed by
  those engaged in it, or more evident marks of a prosperous state of things.
  Every man had some calling to occupy his attention; instances of idleness or
  intemperance were of rare occurrence, the most perfect subordination
  prevailed, and all appeared contented and happy. A foreigner would have found
  it difficult to persuade himself on his first entering the place, that the
  people he now beheld so submissive, industrious and contented, were the same
  people who a few years before has escaped from the shackles of slavery.”
</p>
<p>
  A gentleman who had been for upwards of twenty years past a general merchant
  in Hayti, frequently crossing to Europe and America, gave the following
  account of the condition of the Haytians to Capt. Stuart at Belfast last
  winter. The present population he supposes consists of at least seven hundred
  thousand. He said that there was very universal happiness amongst them,—and
  that though their conduct was not unexceptionable, yet there was a less
  distress, than in any other country of his knowledge. That they obtained
  abundance by their own labor.—There were no paupers except the decrepid [sic]
  and aged: that the people were very charitable, hospitable and kind, very
  respectful to Europeans, temperate, grateful, faithful, orderly and submissive,
  easily governable, lively and contented, good mechanics, and that no corporal
  punishments are allowed.
</p>
"	Ye gads this article is objectionable. It is all about how much the Haitians fit European and capitalist models. Subordination and submission, and the unquestioned superiority of European thought, systems and people is grating.	The argument implicit in this account - that once emancipated, people of African descent will behave like Europeans, and even retain a sense of their place in the hierarchic order - was far too common in these early days of Immediate Abolition. This is, to my ears, another misstep along the road to true allyship between white Abolitionists and African-Americans. On a more positive note, the presence of Haiti as a symbol of Black achievement and independence, was always important, as is borne out in the writings of African-Americans like David Walker, Maria Stewart, and Henry Highland Garnet.

  SALISBURY CATHEDRAL—STONEHENGE—THE SHEPHERD OF SALISBURY PLAIN
</p>
<p align=""right"">
  <em>Salisbury, July</em>
  2, 1833.
</p>
<p>
  The shepherd of Salisbury Plain, Stonehenge, Old Sarum, and Salisbury
  Cathedral are things of some note. The latter is distinguished for its lofty
  spire, four hundred feet; for the purity and uniformity of its architecture,
  external and internal; and for the warped condition of the columns of masonry,
  which support the tower and spire, under the amazing weight that rests upon
  them, and then look us and observe [indecipherable] ready to be crushed. And
  the only reason why it is presumed they will remain, is because they have
  already endured for ages under the same appearances. An extra fixture has been
  thrown in for protection, interposing a monstrous blemish in the perspective
  of the transept. Aside from this the pure Gothic of the entire edifice,
  constitutes the rarest beauty of the kind in the British Isles. It was built
  in the thirteenth century—the spire having been since added, the top of which
  inclines 22 inches from a perpendicular line, in consequence of the warping of
  its supports. An old man now between seventy and eighty, has been accustomed
  to ascend once in a twelve month for many years to oil the weather vane. He
  gets out at a window a few feet below the top, scrambles like a squirrel by
  some iron net work at the giddy elevation of four hundred feet, performs his
  office, and descends with all the self-possession of a sailor. This year,
  however, he has been unable to do his duty on account of the infirmities of
  age.
</p>
<p>
  I rode this morning in a fly, a sort of hackney-coach, drawn by a couple of
  mules, to
  <em>Stonehenge,</em>
  about eight miles from the town, situated in the heart of Salisbury plain, and
  standing insolated in all the grandeur of its mysterious and hitherto
  unexplained history. It is a truly sublime object—sublime in itself, as
  filling the mind with wonder, where the stones came from, how they could have
  been brought there, and placed in their relative positions! The heaviest
  columns are rated at seventy tons—the whole number being ninety-four, as near
  as can be ascertained, although the present confusion of the assemblage
  renders it difficult to count them. It is supposed to have been a Druidical
  temple, where human sacrifices were offered—a superstition as sublime as it
  was diabolical, as mysterious as cruel! The rude grandeur of the work
  demonstrates the barbarity of the age. There are no indications, that this
  place of sacrifice was ever enclosed by walls, or covered by a roof. It is
  encircled indeed by the traces of a ditch and a corresponding embankment, and
  the columnar ranges of stones were set up in circular lines, at greater
  distance from each other than the space occupied. About half an acre is
  enclosed by the circumvallation, and a quarter of an acre occupied by the
  temple itself. The only junction of the structure if structure it can be
  called, appears to have been the resting of the amazing cross and horizontal
  slabs on the largest columns, about 20 ft. high &amp; 15 asunder, most of
  which have fallen, some are inclined, and a few only standing erect. Tenons
  were left on the top of the perpendicular columns, entering grooves of the
  horizontal pieces laid upon them. It is barely possible, that the mechanical
  powers of the present age could set up an edifice like this; but the rudeness
  of the work does not naturally suggest the knowledge and application of such
  powers at the time of its creation. Hence the wonder.
</p>
<p>
  It is said by some, that the same material is not to be found in this island.
  It is incredible, however, that these immense rocks should have been shipped;
  and almost equally incredible, that they should have been transported any
  considerable distance on trundles; and yet they were never found in this
  vicinity. Many of them are reduced to nearly right angles, but more exhibit a
  smooth, or properly plane surface. There is nothing like the skill of masonry
  bestowed upon them. They are perhaps purposely left in this rude state, as
  emblematic of the stern and inexorable rites which they were set up to
  witness. The supposed altar piece lies in the centre, embedded in the earth,
  and directly behind it two of the largest columns supported the heaviest
  cross-beam—but the columns have inclined and dropped their burden.
</p>
<p>
  There are other relics of the kind in the island, but none so stupendous. All
  the parts of a similar temple have been transferred at great expense from the
  island of Jersey, and set up on the estate of a private gentleman at
  Henley-on-Thames, now the property of a Mr. Maitland. I stumbled upon it the
  other day in rambling over the grounds with a friend, and found it perched on
  a hill some four or five hundred feet above the bed of the Thames. It was
  brought over by a former governor of the island, Gen. Conway, who then owned
  Park-place, on which it now stands. It is of course a small chapel, compared
  with
  <em>Stonehenge</em>
  on Salisbury Plain—but many of the stones are of several tons weight. They are
  rude and shapeless.
</p>
<p>
  There are numerous marks of ancient military fortifications, scattered over
  Salisbury Plain; and tumuli of the ancient dead, such as are to be found in
  the Western regions of our own country, lift up their heads in various
  quarters, and sometimes in groups.
</p>
<p>
  Old Sarum, of recent fame, as a rotten borough of England, sending two members
  to Parliament under the late
  <em>regime</em>
  , is a naked fortification in ruins, two miles from Salisbury. It is as
  desolate as the crown of Ben Nevis in Scotland.
</p>
<p>
  My sensations in visiting Stonehenge were the result of a singular combination
  of the grateful recollections of Mrs. More’s Shepherd and his family, and of
  the actual scenes before me. “The Shepherd of Salisbury Plain” was continually
  ringing in my ear, and all his history passing before me, as I rode over these
  undulating, naked, and apparently boundless fields, among the tumuli and
  traces of ancient fortifications, and came at last to gaze upon and admire
  this wonder-exciting and unaccountable relic of a barbarous age and bloody
  superstition. What a demonstration of man’s susceptibilities of religious
  affections, of a sense of guilt, of his need of atonement, and of the dreadful
  errors, into which he may be plunged without the guidance of a divine
  revelation!
</p>
"	An unusual decision, for page one at the time of the trial.

Wonderful memory of Blind Alick	The Unionist	Miscellaneous Filler	"<em>Wonderful memory of Blind Alick.</em>
—There is still living at Stirling, a blind old beggar known to all the country
round by the name of blind Alick, who possesses a memory of almost incredible
strength. It was observed with astonishment, that, when he was a man, and
obliged, by the death of his parents, to gain a livelihood by begging through
the streets of his native town of Stirling, he knew the whole of the Bible, both
Old and New Testaments, by heart! From which you may repeat any passage, and he
will tell you the chapter and verse; or you may tell him the chapter and verse,
and he will repeat to you the passage, word for word. Not long since, a
gentleman, to puzzle him, read, with a slight verbal alteration, a verse of the
Bible. Alick hesitated a moment, and then told where it was to be found but said
it had not been correctly delivered; he then gave it as it stood in the book,
correcting the slight error that had been purposely introduced. The gentleman
then asked him for the 90
<sup>th</sup>
verse of the 7
<sup>th</sup>
chapter of Numbers. Alick was again puzzled for a moment, but then said hastily,
“You are fooling me, sir? there is no such verse—that chapter has only 89
verses.” Several other experiments of the sort were tried upon him with the same
success. He has often been questioned the day after any particular sermon or
speech, and his examiners have invariably found, that, had their patience
allowed, blind Alick would have given them the sermon or speech over again."	Romanticism, but ultimately solid American piety winning, is interesting.	Blind Alick (1766-1839) was a real person, who was contradictorily used both as an example of piety and impiety for his remarkable knowledge of the scriptures. He is now featured in a Ghost Walk in Stirling.	Blind Alick
The Senses Fallible Witnesses	The Unionist	Miscellaneous Filler	"THE SENSES FALLIBLE WITNESSES.—When we bathe in the sea, or in a cold bath, we
are accustomed to consider the water as colder than the air, and the air colder
than the clothes which surround us. Now all these objects are, in fact, the same
temperature. A thermometer surrounded by the cloth of our coat or suspended in
the atmosphere, or immersed in the sea, will stand at the same temperature. A
linen shirt, when first put on, will feel colder than a cotton one, and a
flannel shirt will actually feel warm; yet all these have the same temperature.
The sheets of the bed feel cold, and the blankets warm; the blankets and sheets,
however, are equally warm. A still, calm atmosphere in summer, feels warm, but
if a wind arises the same atmosphere feels cool. Now, a thermometer suspended
under shelter, and in a calm place, will indicate exactly the same temperature
as a thermometer on which the wind blows."		But can we trust the thermometers?
Commerce of China	The Unionist	Foreign News	"COMMERCE OF CHINA. For more than a century past, almost the whole of European
trade has been restricted to Canton and Macao. But it was not always so. At
different times during the reign of the Ming dynasty, the ports of Ningpo and
Chusan in Chekeang, and the port of Amoy in Fuhkeen, were opened to Europeans,
and became large marts for their commerce. Kanghe in the twenty third year of
his reign opened all the ports of his empire, and allowed a
<em>free trade</em> to his own subjects and to all foreign nations. This regulation continued in
force for about thirty years. But at length it was argued against this
regulation, that foreigners and adventurous Chinese who were living abroad would
improverish the country by exporting large quantities of rice! For this, or some
other reasons equally cogent, foreign trade was restricted; the emigration of
natives and the ingress of foreigners, were prohibited; and, if we mistake not,
the building of vessels on the European model was likewise interdicted. —

Tattling	The Unionist	Miscellaneous Filler	"TATTLING. “He that keepeth his mouth, keepeth his life.” It is very common for

may be said and spread abroad, when there is not the least shadow of truth in
the story. And it is against this species of tattling which I wish to guard
mankind. The wise man knew how prone the world was to this sin when he said,—“he
that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life.” And truly that person who is careful
what he says—especially when he knows it is in his power to injure the character
of a person, or thwart any of his purposes—acts up to the proverb, and gains the

<p align=""center"">TRIAL OF MISS PRUDENCE CRANDALL.</p>
<p align=""center"">(continued.)</p>
<p>
  Mr Ellsworth, after stating the case, and remarking on the prohibitions of the
  law, said that he proposed not to occupy time in relation to the facts of the
  case. He would willingly have advised the pupils of Miss Crandall to have
  testified had he not believed that in so doing they voluntarily surrendered
  their most sacred rights. True it was, the defendant has kept this
  school—‘twas no secret, and whether that constituted a crime or not was for
  the jury to determine. In order to convict my client, said Mr.E., you,
  gentlemen, must find on your oaths that she has committed a crime. You may
  find that she has violated an act of the State legislature, but if you also
  find her protected by a higher power, it will be your duty to acquit. The
  court he was fully assured, would charge the jury that the law was
  unconstitutional, if they so believed, but after all, it belonged to the people
  to determine whether one of them had been guilty of a crime. Each one of the
  jury must be satisfied for himself alone, that a crime has been committed. He
  flattered himself that he should be able to lead them to the conclusion that
  the law in question was a violation of the constitution of this State and of
  the United States.—The constitution of the United States was the highest power
  known in our land. Beyond that, no Legislature can go, and if the jury find
  the law not to stand well with the constitution they must say so.
</p>
<p>
  The real question for the jury to settle Mr Ellsworth apprehended to be this:
  Can the Legislature of Connecticut pass a law prohibiting the citizens of
  other States from coming into this State, and there residing, to prosecute the
  acquisition of knowledge, in a way open to the citizens of this State. This he
  believed was the precise question, and it reached deep and wide—wider and
  deeper than was perhaps imagined. It was however claimed by his friend from
  Canterbury, that colored persons were not citizens, and that the provisions of
  the constitution, with respect to citizens of the United States, did not apply
  to this class of our population. The criterion of citizenship was complexion,
  in the view of the gentleman who had preceded him. I, said Mr E., make the
  criterion to be either birth or naturalization. Admitting that none but white
  persons can be naturalized, it does not touch the question of citizenship by
  birth. Is it so that a person born on our soil, is not a citizen of our soil?
  In the days of Revolution, said Mr E., these men fought side by side with our
  fathers, and shed their blood for this country, which as their country—the
  country to which they owed indefeasible allegiance. Their names were now
  inscribed on the Pension Rolls of the Government—they now received the
  honorable trophies of the services they had rendered. Where, said Mr E., does
  the gentleman get the doctrine that the rights of man, as a citizen, depend
  upon his color? A colored man could appeal to the laws for the protection of
  his rights in every State; could he, if he were not a citizen? (Mr. E. here
  read a few sentences from the commencement of the declaration of independence,
  which, he said, according to the argument of the gentleman opposed to him,
  ought to be changed so as to have the words “except black people” introduced
  between each clause). Mr E. said he was a republican, he claimed to be as much
  of a republican as his friend from Canterbury, and he hoped that his friend
  was not so ashamed of his republicanism, as to wish this instrument, the
  Declaration of Independence, interpolated in this manner. Our own
  constitution, continued Mr E., recognized, in express terms, equality of
  rights—that men were equal in rights, but to this the gentleman would add
  “except black men.” He hoped he should not live long enough to see such
  doctrine go forth from Connecticut. The free colored population has, and is
  justly entitled, to equal representation in the Congress of the United States
  with the white population. Could not a black man commit treason? The gentleman
  would have it that he could not, for none other than citizens can. (Mr E. here
  read from the 2d Kent’s Com. on the subject of citizenship, by birth.) I scout
  the Idea, said Mr E., that a man, born here by the side of me, is not a
  citizen because, his father was black, while I am a citizen because mine was
  white.
</p>
<p>
  Mr E. said that the argument which his friend had drawn from the fact that our
  state constitution provided that none but white citizens should become
  electors, would seem to be based on the assumption that the right of voting
  was a criterion of citizenship. Is this, he asked, the fact? Was the right of
  voting a test of citizenship? If it is, where are our wives and daughters?
  Citizens, or not? Would the gentleman denationalize them? How could persons
  born here be aliens? Mr E. then proceeded to examine more minutely the
  abstract question which he had before stated. It was, he said, a great
  question, one which he had not doubt would make a figure in the future history
  of this country. If, said Mr E., resident citizens of this state may choose
  their own instructors, then, he believe, that citizens from other states, here
  by their sides, may also choose theirs. If the Legislature of Connecticut can
  say to a black citizen of New York that he shall not come here to be
  instructed he may say so to the white citizen. Where is the distinction? It
  comes then to this, our Legislature can say as to the population of an
  adjacent state, for instance New York, it is corrupt, and its citizens shall
  not come within our limits—be they white or black it makes no difference. A
  barrier was thus at once erected around our state. An absurdity so manifest as
  this must strike every mind. Nothing but a high state of excitement could ever
  have caused the enactment of such a law as the present. The citizens of
  Canterbury he had no doubt, would, on reflection, perceive the impropriety of
  their course. The care and supervision which the Legislature had exercised
  over schools in this state did not, as Mr E. apprehended imply the right to
  exercise any such power as that set up in the new law.
</p>
<p>
  The law, which regulate trades and professions, to which allusion has been
  made, were also, he said, of an entirely different character. These
  regulations and restrictions, it must be remembered, were the same for all.
  Whether one belonged to the state or not, these laws knew no difference. The
  new law has made a difference, and in that consisted the difficulty. The
  application of the new law must depend upon the fact whether a person was born
  in or out of the state. The Legislature leave the black man born here, the
  freedom of selecting his own instructor, and the place of instruction for his
  child. This privilege is denied to the black man who comes here, if it so
  happens that he was born out of the state. But, says the gentleman, his
  children may go to the district schools, to any of the high schools of
  academies in the state. The benefits which colored children would derive from
  these schools, said Mr E. would not be worth a pinch of snuff, and the
  gentleman knows it.—The blacks in Hartford had petitioned for a separate
  school, in order that they might have the benefit of the public money, which
  they did not enjoy now, as they were ever made hewers of wood and drawers of
  water, and considered the offscouring of the schools which they attended. They
  made commotion in every school the moment they entered it. There existed then
  a necessity for separate schools.—He was not going abreast of any principle of
  supervision which the state could properly exercise over schools, or over
  trades and professions, by contending for the rights of citizens to choose
  their own instructors, and the place of instruction, for their children,
  whether they were or were not citizens of this state. The old statute in
  relation to paupers was considered as upholding this law. By it, persons
  liable to become chargeable might be warned to depart, and might be publicly
  whipped if they did not obey the mandate. He would here thank his friend from
  Canterbury for obtaining a repeal of that portion of the law by which whipping
  was imposed. Mr E. apprehended that a state possessed the power of preventing
  the settlement, within its limits, of those likely to become paupers, but that
  the state had the power of keeping out every body from other states, he denied
  altogether. Will it be said that the law in question does not go to this extent?
  If a citizen of Massachusetts may come into this state and settle down, what
  is he here for? Must he be a drone? What is the privilege of moving worth to
  him? Citizens of other states may come here and become farmers, or lawyers,
  (that would be a poor business, said Mr E.) or doctors. They may, when here,
  said Mr E. do what citizens here may do, or the constitution is not worth a
  rush. ‘Twas claimed that blacks might come here and go to other schools. Might
  not the Legislature then say to them, and to all others, you shall send your
  children to the Presbyterian school—to the Baptist school, or to the Methodist
  school? Might not the Legislature further say, we do not like Roman Catholics,
  and we will therefore have no school where Catholics instruct? Gentlemen must
  go this length, who advocate this law. Would it be claimed that the fact of
  putting this power in the hands of the select men to exercise, made any
  difference? This was a mere parade of liberality—the select men of Canterbury
  would sooner shed their blood than grant Miss Crandall permission to keep this
  school. The power to license, said Mr E., is a power to deny—and we are to
  hold our most sacred rights and privileges at the pleasure of the select men;
  they can grant or they can prohibit.
</p>
<p>
  Mr E. now proceeded to consider the rights which citizens of each state are
  entitled to enjoy in the several states. He read from the opinion of Judge
  Washington, as reported in the 4
  <sup>th</sup>
  of Washington’s Circuit Court Reps. page 380, which he claimed showed
  conclusively that the new law of Connecticut was unconstitutional. He also
  maintained that the views he took of this law were supported by Judge Story,
  in the third volume of his recent work on the Constitution and also in
  Sergeant’s Constitutional law, page 385. The legislation of Congress on the
  subject of the Missouri question, he claimed distinctly recognized blacks as
  Citizens. The law when it says that no person shall keep a school for the
  instruction of blacks from abroad, says, in effect, that no foreign person
  shall come here and be taught—How were they to be taught without a teacher?
  This law would extinguish the light of knowledge—would degrade those who are
  now degraded, and depress those who are now depressed. It said to the naked,
  go unclothed, and to the hungry, go unfed. The distinctions which now existed
  on account of color were sufficiently great—the colored people had now
  difficulties enough to struggle with—he hoped they would not be increased.
</p>
<p>
  The general policy of this law, continued Mr E., and its connexion with the
  subject of slavery, though a question touching deep feelings, cannot, without
  impropriety, be discussed here. Had he been a member of the legislature that
  enacted it, he might have said something on the subject, but should refrain
  from it on the present occasion.
</p>
<p>
  In conclusion, Mr. Ellsworth thanked the jury for the attention they had paid
  to his remarks, which, he said, were quite unsatisfactory to himself. He hoped
  they would see their way clear, before they found his client guilty of a crime
  for endeavoring to elevate and enlighten an unfortunate portion of our race.
  Were they prepared to say that teaching the word of God was a crime? That it
  was a crime to teach children the Bible? He left the case with them. He
  trusted that the court would tell them that the law was unconstitutional, but
  if they should not, my appeal, said Mr E., is to THE PEOPLE, and to THE PEOPLE
  I leave my client.
</p>
<p>
  Mr. Strong said that after the very full, and eloquent, and conclusive
  argument of his brother Ellsworth, it would be more grateful to his feelings to
  leave the case in the hands of the jury without adding a word. He feared that
  he should rather diminish than add to the force of that argument. He however
  found an apology for occupying a short time, in the magnitude of the
  case under consideration. It involves the liberties of the people.
</p>
<p>
  Those who advocate the cause of the defendant, said Mr. S., are charged with
  endeavoring to nullify the laws. What is nullification? An attempt by the
  Legislature of a state, to destroy a power higher than itself. South Carolina
  had done this to the fullest extent—our own state had made some progress, but
  the right of trial by jury was still left us. A culprit is here arraigned—a
  female—by the courtesy of the court she had not been called upon to hold up
  her hand, and plead to the information against her, but she nevertheless stood
  there as a criminal. She was charged with giving instruction, but there was no
  pretence that she has inculcated bad principles. He had heard of a land where
  this might be criminal, but it was a land where despots reigned. Her crime
  consisted in this, that she had given light to those who were in mental
  darkness—had taught those who were ignorant, to read the bible. It was true
  that the persons to whom she had given instruction were descendants of that
  unfortunate race, who were even in a state of slavery in this country. He said
  this not to their reproach, but to our own. He rejoiced that public sentiment
  had changed on the subject—but one feeling now exists &amp; that was not
  peculiar to our own country. The Legislature of Great Britain was engaged in
  passing a law of a very different character from the one now in question, at
  the very time that our Legislature passed this. Even in a country where a king
  and nobles constituted one branch of the legislature, a law had been passed,
  almost simultaneously with our own, strikingly dissimilar in its provisions.
  We complained that this class of persons were low, degraded, and addicted to
  crime. Has God made them so, or have they been made so by ignorance? ‘Twas a
  little boon to give them liberty, and keep them in ignorance. Better to rivet
  the chains of slavery, then to break those and rivet again the chains of
  ignorance. But one sentiment now pervaded the people of this country, with
  respect to educating these people—there was a difference as to the way. Some
  were for colonizing them, others had different views, but all agreed they
  ought to be instructed in some way. If they were carried out of the country in
  ignorance, was it not carrying them away that they might destroy themselves.
  Unless education accompanied them all was in vain. What, asked Mr. S., has
  been the course pursued by the defendant? He rejoiced that her pupils had been
  before the jury, and that they had had opportunities of seeing them. Were they
  not worthy of being instructed? Had not the defendant entirely deferred to
  public sentiment, in relation to keeping the races separate? What more
  feasible course for educating these people could be point out, than the one
  she had adopted? The colored race could not educate themselves—unless some
  person would step forward and overcome these prejudices, whether rightful or
  not, he should not decide, they must ever live in ignorance.
</p>
<p>MR. STRONG, next proceeded to remark on the law.</p>
<p>
  He read the preamble and said it put him in mind of the painter, who affixed a
  label to his pictures, lest the spectators might not otherwise be able to
  determine what animal he intended to delineate. The question, continued Mr S.,
  is often asked, ""would you be willing to have a school of this description in
  your own neighborhood?” What if we should not, could we put it down by passing
  an unconstitutional law? What if I did not wish my neighbor to keep a large
  number of dogs, could I of course compel him to put them away? This law does
  not prevent colored persons from coming to this State. They may come and be
  idle, and welcome—they may come for any earthly purpose except education. That
  they are told they must get in the district schools. In these schools, the
  colored class sit on the lowest bench. They cannot go to these schools—as soon
  as their minds become a little expanded, they must retire from them. He wished
  to have an instance pointed out where any black had continued to attend, for
  any length of time, and derived benefit. It was impossible that such should be
  the case as things now were. What they desired was a school by themselves,
  where, and only where, they could acquire an education. They asked of us
  bread, but we gave them a stone—they asked a fish, but we gave them a
  scorpion—there was the sting of reproach in it. We place our foot on the
  black, and hold him down in the dust, and then complain that he does not grow
  to the perfect stature of a man. There was but one Academy in the State where
  they could be admitted at all, and this was by the munificence of a private
  individual—he alluded to the late Mr Bacon of Colchester. He should have
  supposed by the argument of the gentleman who opened the case for the
  prosecution, that the new act would open the doors [of] every academy and
  college in the State. The proviso in the law amounted to nothing—it might as
  well have provided that nothing in that act should be construed to prevent
  colored persons from holding all the Bank stock in the State. The act exposed
  one to penalties who should instruct a colored person, from another State, in
  a sabbath school. It compelled us to obtain a license to seek out the poor,
  the ignorant, the destitute, and the benighted.
</p>
<p>
  It is claimed, said Mr S., that the legislature have the power to regulate
  schools—be it so. He asked however to be pointed to an instance where the
  regulation depended on the character of the scholar. This law excluded those
  whom it pronounced bad. He would say, let all be instructed, particularly the
  bad that they might be made better. He spoke however with confidence, when he
  said, that no law had ever existed, in this State, to regulate private school.
  (Mr S. then read from some of the ancient statutes, regulating schools,
  appointing inspectors, &amp;c.) The legislature, continued Mr S., regulated
  these schools because they had established them, and they undoubtedly might do
  so. Was this power claimed in order to prevent bad principles from being
  taught? He did not perceive that the defendant had offended in this respect.
  There was nothing bad in teaching arithmetic, geography, grammar, and the
  bible. If this however was the object of the law, whom did it protect? Our own
  citizens? No—we might teach them every thing naughty that we chose, but were
  restrained from doing so to those who came from abroad. This, said Mr S., is
  really the most
  <em>diffusive</em>
  kind of benevolence I ever heard of. Most of our criminal laws, continued Mr
  S., gives the court some discretionary power in imposing punishment, in this
  law the penalty is fixed, if the law itself be not fixed—if it be not pierced
  by the spear which emanated from the constitution. All public officers are
  sworn to support the constitution of the United States, and if any law
  interferes with that, it must be disregarded—otherwise they would incur the
  guilt of perjury. Whether any of the jury had taken this oath, he knew not,
  nor was it material to his argument. The Constitution of the United States was
  the supreme law, and must be regarded by all citizens, whether public officers
  or not. He meant to speak with all respect of the opinion of the Court, and
  though in civil matters the jury were bound to take the law as given from the
  Bench, it was otherwise in criminal questions. Here the Court advise, and the
  jury decide.

  He intended no disrespect to the legislature which enacted this law, by the
  animadversions which he made concerning it. It was notorious that public
  feeling frequently exercised a strong influence in regard to the passage of
  laws. As an instance of this, he would refer to a law passed a few years since
  in this State, called the Steam-boat law. In this law, we cut off many of our
  privileges for the sake of retaliating on the State of New-York. The law was
  passed by acclamation. Gov. Wolcott sent a sensible well written message to
  the legislature, suggesting its impolicy and unconstitutionality, but it was
  no more regarded than if he had sent a page of the spelling book—it did not
  change a vote. The Dartmouth College case was another instance of the passage
  of a State law, in time of high excitement. Again and again had our sacred
  constitution been called to exert its conservative principle.
</p>
<p>
  Mr S. said that it was with some surprise that he had listened to the
  statement of the opening Counsel for the prosecution, as to the law of
  Pennsylvania, relating to the residence of blacks in their limits. What the
  gentleman asserted to be the law of that State, which he had so properly
  styled “the land of Penn,” was a bill reported to the legislature, but never
  passed into a law. Other bills had been framed and prepared to pass, in other
  legislatures, which Mr S. apprehended would form a miscellaneous collection.
  It would greatly gratify his curiosity, could he get a sight of some of them.
  It was no reflection on the character of our State, that under excitement, it
  had passed an unconstitutional law—other States had done the same. Mr S. here
  referred to the second section of the 4<sup>th</sup>
  Article of the constitution, on which he said he relied to prove the
  unconstitutionality of the law. He also read from the articles of
  confederation, which he claimed to contain a similar provision. By the
  adoption of the constitution, we were, said Mr S., made one people. ‘Twas
  necessary—‘twas the principle of the proclamation of Gen. Jackson, so
  deservedly popular throughout this section of the Country. If this principle
  was impugned, it destroyed that which alone made our government worth
  anything. (Mr. S. also read from Judge Story what had before been quoted by Mr
  Ellsworth) In ancient times, continued Mr S., it was a proud boast—“I am a
  Roman citizen.” A citizen of the United States was entitled to one no less
  proud—I am an American citizen. We were not to say that we were citizens of
  Connecticut, but that we were American citizens. A portion of our country men
  might wish to raise the Palmetto banner, but the eagle and the stripes were
  our badge. The attorney for the prosecution would improve upon the
  Nullification of South Carolina. That State had only to pass an act excluding
  the standing army o the United States from her territory, and the principles
  of the old General’s proclamation were all nullified, or Mr S. was greatly
  mistaken. Were blacks citizens? The term “citizen” was to have a technical
  sense. He had listened with pleasure to this remark from the gentleman who
  opened the case, for when a word has a technical signification, it was always
  easy to get its precise meaning. All the technics however which seemed to
  attach to the word were that a citizen must not be colored. If colored persons
  were not citizens, Mr S. claimed that they were not inhabitants, which
  conclusion was manifestly absurd. Color had no connection with the question of
  citizenship by birth, though it had in respect to naturalization. In deference
  to southern views, the Militia laws of the nation, passed in 1792, did not
  include colored persons—the words were, “every free white male citizen”—was
  not this an express recognition that persons other than whites were citizens?
  If “citizens” meant a white person only, why was this language used? (Mr S.
  here read from Ingersoll’s digest 745, relative to the protections granted to
  American seamen, which, he said were always given to blacks as well as
  whites.) The war of 1812 was caused, continued Mr S., in no small degree, by
  the impressment of our seamen who had these protections in their pockets. Our
  government considered the impressment of blacks who had these protections, as
  standing on the same ground with the impressment of the whites, and the war
  was declared and fought as much on their account as on account of the whites.
  The law in relation to American shipping required that in order to be entitled
  to discriminating duties at the custom house, it must be owned in whole or in
  part, by American Citizens. Colored persons frequently owned ships which were
  uniformly regarded as the property of American citizens.
</p>
<p>Mr S. named Paul Cuffee as an instance.</p>
<p>
  The courts of the United States were open to citizens and also to
  aliens—aliens, however, must describe themselves as such, in order to maintain
  an action. The uniform practice was for blacks to sue as citizens, never as
  aliens. Mr S. here read from Kent’s Com. and claimed from the doctrine there
  advanced that a black might go from one State to another, and enjoy in that
  other, the same privileges that a person of the same class enjoyed who
  belonged to that other State, I do not claim, said Mr S., that a citizen of an
  other State coming into this State, brings all privileges with him which he
  before enjoyed—he brings with him however the character of a citizen of the
  United States, and that entitles him to enjoy here, the same privileges with
  our citizens under circumstances similar to his own.
</p>
<p>
  Gen. Jackson, said Mr S., in his proclamation at New Orleans, addressed the
  blacks as “fellow citizens.” Did he mean to insult them? No, he meant to
  recognize them as citizens and the law so recognized them. They could purchase
  and hold real estate, could gain a settlement, and could, in fact, do what
  citizen[s] could, and what aliens could not do. It would be an insult to talk
  of naturalizing a man born here. The constitution of our State had been
  alluded to, in order to prove that blacks were not citizens, because it did
  not allow them to vote. Voting was not test of citizenship. If it was then by
  the showing of the gentleman, blacks were citizens, for in New York they were
  allowed to vote, and were therefore, according to the gentleman, citizens of
  the United States in New York; of course they were citizens here.
</p>
<p>
  Mr Strong here replied to the arguments which had been drawn from the course
  of legislation pursued by other States in respect to the blacks—the law of
  Ohio, &amp;c. He read the law of Louisiana, which affixed a penalty of $500 or
  the first offence of instruct[ing] a black in the Sabbath Schools, death for
  the second. The jury, he said, were not to regard the laws of other States as
  necessarily giving the true construction to the Constitution.—These laws, if
  unconstitutional, did not support our law, and it was their province to decide
  their constitutionality. He also referred to a late opinion of Judge Baldwin,
  given in the Circuit Court of the United States, and also to the opinion of
  Judge Washington before referred to, with respect to the rights of citizens of
  the U. States in the several states.
</p>
<p>
  Our ancient law, said Mr. S., which allowed persons to be carried out of the
  State, who were not citizens, was restrained from operating on apprentices,
  because they came for the acquisition of knowledge.—While minors were
  prevented from contracting for any thing but necessaries, they were allowed in
  express terms, to contract for the purpose of education.—Was education, he
  asked, a fundamental right? Ferdinand of Spain, he presumed did not believe
  that it was, neither did that king who was now chased through Portugal—and
  why? because education was the basis of liberty. Should such however be the
  doctrine of this free land? If our law had said that blacks in this state
  should not be educated at all, though inhuman and unchristian, it would not be
  liable to the same objections that it now is. The case seemed to him as plain
  as any he had ever submitted to a jury. The conclusion followed on the heel of
  the premises. If a school was opened to blacks who belonged to this state, it
  was certain it must be open to those who came from other states, under the
  same circumstances, for by the Constitution of the United States, they were
  entitled to a community of rights.
</p>
<p>
  As it regarded the license, which, under this law, might be obtained of the
  select men and civil authority, ‘twas nothing at all—it would not be given,
  but, if it would, we were not bound to ask it. As well might we be told that
  we should not eat without their permission. That would merely starve the
  body—this starved the mind—it kept on husks that which confer[s] on man his
  immortality.
</p>
<p>
  It was claimed that we had other laws of a similar character. ‘Twas no
  matter—it made this law no better—doing wrong once was no apology for doing it
  again, much less did it create a right to do it. Make the law equal as to its
  application and he would find no fault.
</p>
<p>
  He took the case of Eliza Glasko—she was an inhabitant of the state, and Ann
  Eliza Hammond was not. What difference could the Legislature make in relation
  to these persons as to the right to attend what school they chose? As to the
  law requiring citizens of other states to give bonds before they could
  maintain an action in our Courts, it operated equally—citizens of our state,
  if they resided out, were subject to the law—it depended simply on residence.
  The law providing against the settlement of paupers would not sustain this
  law. That required bonds for the support of those likely to become chargeable.
  Bonds were not sought here, except the bonds which tie the mind, and fetter
  the man—not bonds of security, but bonds of vassalage. It cannot, said Mr S.
  be sustained. The people would not endure the alien law of ‘98—‘twas abhorrent
  to the principles of our government, and drove from power the man that made
  it. This law has features even more odious than that. The people will not and
  ought not to endure it. By sanctioning this law, he said the jury would
  sanction a principle which would prevent them or their sons from emigrating to
  the western states.
</p>
<p>
  He trusted he need spend no more time—he believed they would do their duty. He
  should ask the court to charge them that the law was obnoxious to the charges
  he has made against it, but should the court do otherwise, his appeal was to
  them. It was their prerogative to pass upon this law which owed its creation
  to an excited state of feeling. To them he looked for a verdict which would
  maintain civil liberty.
</p>
<p>
  Mr WELCH regretted the duty that had devolved upon him [in] his state of health,*
  and his recent connexion with the case, would, he said, perhaps prevent him
  from doing to the case even that justice which might have been in his
  power to do under other circumstances. Besides the eloquence and ingenuity of
  the defendant’s counsel might have diverted the mind of the jury from the real
  issue. He should discharge his duty without personal feeling. If he had before
  harbored any, he should strive to banish it from his mind now. He wished the
  right of the state of Connecticut to be fairly, impartially, and
  dispassionately examined. The government asked no conviction but upon
  principles which could be consistently reconciled with justice and the
  constitution. The fact that the defendant was a female had been alluded to,
  but this altered not her rights. She had the same and none other rights, than
  every citizen. Her hoped the jury would not be misled by the impassioned
  flashes of eloquence which they had heard from her counsel. He would have them
  pause and examine. The rights of the judge and the beggar were the same at the
  bar of justice. Rights there, were common, but artificial rights in society
  were different. The rights of citizens had been pressed upon their
  attention—the rights of states must not be forgotten.
</p>
<p>
  Was the law Constitutional? Possibly it was not. Laws has been passed which
  undoubtedly were unconstitutional, and if this was, he asked no conviction
  under it. They had but one course to pursue. If the law was contrary to the
  constitution they were bound to acquit—no one, if such was the character of
  the law, would acquiesce in the decision more cheerfully than himself. The
  gentlemen opposed to him has said, very emphatically, that they appealed to
  the people if the court decided the law to be constitutional. The jury, he
  said, were the people. It was no doubt true that in criminal cases the jury
  could decide [thus] in spite of the court, but, was it enviable? Would they
  desire to do it? Rights were at stake, the rights of the state as well as the
  rights of the party.—He would have the jury look at the result of their
  verdict as it respected the effects it would have on these rights. They might
  take the law into their own hands and acquit the defendant. They sacrificed
  the rights of the state beyond remedy by doing so—their verdict against the
  state was final. If, however, they found a verdict against the defendant, it
  had no such effect on her. The case could be carried to another tribunal where
  she could have perfect justice, and where her rights would not be at all
  prejudiced by a conviction here. ‘Twas no hardship to her, and a contrary
  course might do an irremediable wrong to the state.
</p>
<p>
  They had been told that they had, that day, to decide a great question—an
  exciting one. It was true. Why then had they been called so loudly to take the
  case from the court? If they decided the law to be unconstitutional ‘twould be
  no evidence except between the same parties as a matter of fact. Another jury
  might decide the law to be constitutional, and thus what was a crime at one
  time would be no crime at another, though tried under the same law. He had no
  idea that they had any motive but to discharge impartially their duties as
  jurors.
</p>
<p>
  Mr W. said, that as the defendant, by her plea, had put all the facts
  necessary to her conviction in issue, he should now examine the proof. The
  counsel for the defence had seemed tacitly to admit the facts charged to be
  true, but as he did not mean to desert any part of the case which the
  gentlemen opposed to him had not distinctly admitted to be in favor of the
  prosecution, he should recapitulate the evidence, and see if a case had been
  made out. (Mr W. here examined the testimony, commented upon it at length, and
  claimed that it was perfectly conclusive.)
</p>
<p>
  The gentlemen who had argued for the defence, said Mr W., never meant to make
  the constitutionality of this law a point in the case. They thought they had
  thrown a barrier around their client by closing the mouths of witnesses. It
  was the object of the gentlemen to go out of court in triumph for want of
  proof to convict, but the grating doors of a certain building, though it did
  not unstop deaf ears, did open dumb mouths. The witnesses then spoke,
  notwithstanding the gentlemen had hoped to apply to them the gag law. Their
  efforts had proved ineffectual—their flag was furled, and when he saw the
  quivering step of a retreating army he believed that they anticipated defeat.
</p>
<p>
  Mr W. rejoiced that a spirit was going abroad to improve the colored race.
  ‘Twas one thing however to produce a reformation by proper and legal means and
  another by improper and illegal ones. He would refrain no longer from
  considering the constitutional question in the case. The law was called
  unconstitutional because it was said to prohibit free persons of color from
  coming into this state, from other states, to be educated. Mr W. said that he
  knew no better way of testing constitutionality of a law, than a comparison of
  the law with the provisions of the constitution. Whenever they came in
  collision, it was easy to decide which must stand.—By this test then, by a
  comparison of the letter of the law with the letter of the constitution, he
  perceived no discrepancy. (Mr W. here read the second section of the fourth
  article of the constitution and then read the law.) Now, continued Mr W. this
  law does not prohibit any one from coming here for any purpose, if permission
  be obtained. If it is on the prohibition that gentlemen claim the law to be
  unconstitutional. But if permission be granted in all cases when asked, as
  possibly it may be, where is the unconstitutionality of the law? The gentlemen
  claim that it is prohibitory and therefore unconstitutional—it may never be
  prohibitory; how then is it unconstitutional? In order, gentlemen, said Mr W.,
  to determine that this law is unconstitutional, you must look through the
  vista of coming time, and with a keen prophetic vision, foresee that the civil
  authority will never grant their license. You must settle a question of face
  which you cannot settle. If you can find this fact, put it in your
  verdict—render this libel on your understandings along with it—such a
  principle as this ought not to be contended for—the tears of contrition should
  blot it out, and the blush of shame should light a fire to consume it.
</p>
<p>
  In respect to the meaning of the term “citizen” in the constitution, Mr. W.
  claimed that the ground taken by Mr. Judson, in opening the case, was
  tenable—that the term was used in a technical sense. He denied that it meant
  all persons who lived and moved within certain limits, as he understood the
  gentleman to claim. (Mr. W. here read from the articles of confederation, to
  support his construction of the term “citizen.”) He said that his brother
  Strong had read this quotation of a long trot, as though he feared the jury
  would understand it, and perceive the fallacy of his argument. Mr W. claimed
  that there was a distinction between the term “people” or “inhabitants,” in
  the article of confederation, and the term “citizens” in the constitution. He
  also read from Dr. Webster’s dictionary the definition of “citizen,” and
  insisted that blacks do not come within it.—Mr. W. also read and commented on
  the subject of naturalization, and claimed that Congress had never treated
  blacks as capable of becoming citizens. It was not the policy of the
  government. The Missouri question had been alluded to, but the whole of it was
  one continued act of political juggling—he should not think of appealing to it
  as authority for any thing.
</p>
<p>
  Mr. W. said that he derived a strong argument in construction which he gave
  the constitution from the usages and legislation of other states. He then went
  on to remark at length upon the statutes of many of the states, in relation to
  the black population. If blacks were citizens he said the legislatures of many
  of the states must be called worse than Turkish tyrants—He dwelt with much
  emphasis and ability on the laws of Massachusetts and Rhode Island,
  prohibiting the intermarriage of whites and blacks. These laws said Mr. W.,
  could only be reconciled with the constitution on the ground that blacks were
  not citizens. The right of education had been called a fundamental right. He
  was not disposed to contest the truth of this position. The right of selecting
  the partner of one’s joys and sorrows was however a right no less dear, no
  less sacred, than the right of selecting those whom we will have to educate
  our children. If our law was unconstitutional it was clear that all these laws
  to which he had alluded were also unconstitutional. He did not believe they
  were—the fact that they had been acquiesced in so long was evidence conclusive
  to his mind that they were not.
</p>
<p>
  The case had been so fully gone into by his associate who opened the case,
  that he would not detain the jury longer. He put the rights of the state into
  their hands, and also the rights of the defendant, under direction of the
  court as to the law. They were not to inquire whether their verdict would
  advance the power of one party of another—whether it would feed or allay the
  excitement which existed. They should forget all that did not legitimately
  belong to the case—even the eloquence of the gentleman wo had argued for the
  defence should be forgotten, so far as it was not relevant. Duties were
  theirs—consequences devolved elsewhere.
</p>
<p>His Honor Judge EATON then charged the jury in substance as follows.</p>
<p><em>Gentlemen of the Jury:</em></p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prudence
  Crandall is charged in the information before you, with a violation of a
  certain statute law of this state, forbidding the setting up of a school for
  the instruction of colored persons, not inhabitants of this state, or boarding
  or harboring them for the purpose of instruction. Provided the acts charged
  are proved to be done, the day is not material, if since the passage of the
  law, and before the filing of the information. Neither are the names nor the
  number of the persons instructed material. The facts must be proved to your
  satisfaction, gentlemen, and whether they are so or not you are the sole
  judges—it is not the duty of the court even to advise in relation to the
  measure of proof.
</p>
<p>
  As to the law of the case, this also belongs to you to decide, but the Court
  has a duty to perform with regard to it. That duty is, to advise you as to its
  validity and constitutionality. It has been claimed at the Bar that the law is
  unconstitutional, and that the state legislature had no power to pass it. It
  is gratifying to the court, gentlemen, that its opinion is not final—that it
  can be revised by a higher tribunal, and corrected if erroneous. The opinion
  of the Court is, that the law is constitutional and obligatory on the people
  of this state.—You will take the case into consideration, gentlemen, and
  render a verdict of guilty or not guilty, as to you shall seem just and
  proper.
</p>
<p>
  The jury retired, and after an absence of several hours, returned into Court
  not having agreed on a verdict. They were again ordered out, and again
  returned not having agreed. The third time they stated to the court that there
  was no probability that they should ever agree. The court then discharged
  them. This operates as a continuance of the case to the next term of the
  County Court to be holden on the second Tuesday of December
  next.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  Mr. Editor. It is truly astonishing to witness the efforts at
  misrepresentation in the last Advertiser respecting Miss Crandall’s trial.—It
  is the part of wisdom in the many correspondents to that paper that they have
  not signed their names to the articles communicated. An article appears headed
  thus, “Effects of abolition principles in a Court of Justice.” The writer
  attempts, in his way, to question the veracity of persons who were called upon
  to testify, when they said that they had drank tea with Miss Crandall and her
  scholars but could not recollect the countenances of any who were then in
  court. From this circumstance the writer wishes to convey the idea to his
  readers that they were guilty of swearing falsely, and thus were it in his
  power, would he fix upon them the seal of infamy. The writer of that article
  should know, that however much honorable men may differ from him in sentiment,
  merely a difference of opinion does not render them incapable of speaking the
  truth, and whenever he touches upon an honorable man’s character, he touches a
  very tender spot. However lightly he may regard it,—character, in the
  estimation of some men—some abolitionists we trust—ay, even some who have had
  the hardihood to
  <em>sit at the same table</em>
  with Miss Crandall and her colored misses—is above all price. The writer
  thinks it is a most incredible circumstance that a person could drink tea with
  20 misses whom he never saw before, and 2 or 3 months afterwards, when he
  should see misses in a public assembly, could not recollect that they were the
  persons with whom he drank tea. Perhaps they were present at the table, and
  perhaps they were not. But suppose they were—would it be any thing strange for
  a
  <em>gentleman</em>
  to sit down at table with 20 misses, half of them perhaps, sitting in a direct
  line with himself, (so that it would be extremely difficult for him to see
  them) and not seeing their countenances so as immediately to recollect them
  when seen a number of weeks afterwards, with their bonnets on—in a different
  attire—in a “court of Justice?” Surely these gentlemen—as they said they could
  not recollect them—must be set down as liars, for no one can doubt—considering
  the circumstances—that there was a
  <em>reasonable possibility</em>
  of their not knowing them at a glance—whether they were there or not. We would
  advise the writer of that article to look up much reckless villains and have
  them tried for perjury.

  “Philosophy, though eagle-eyed in nature’s tendencies” has not succeeded in
  drawing a line of discrimination between the members of the human family, so
  marked as to proscribe from the commonwealth of humanity those who Cowper says
  are “guilty of a skin not colored like his own.” Indeed if my complexion does
  afford proof that I am not so nobly born, not endowed with the same
  unalienable privileges and rights as those of a different color, I declare
  that I am not ambitious of attaining their prerogatives, by changing skins
  with any of them—and much less do I repine at the decrees of Him who has made
  of one blood all the nations of the earth.

  Though in the New-England States color is not deemed a sufficient offence to
  consign the limbs of the tawny inhabitant to the shackle, and his back to the
  scourge, yet the prejudices of the South are not wholly unfelt in the North;
  although the fetter falls from the limb of the African, when his foot touches
  the New England soil, still there lingers about the heart of a yankee some of
  that bitterness and contempt towards his colored brethren, which forged
  galling chains for that oppressed race.

  Many specious arguments have been advanced to prove the justness of African
  Slavery, and although many honest men have met and refuted them, others have
  allowed themselves to be wheedled into the comfortable idea, that they are
  made of better clay, and entitled to more consideration, than their degraded
  sufferers. Let me call upon
  <em>you</em>
  , who have still a small proportion of humanity left in your bosoms, to start
  from the siren flaterers, who would lull you to repose, while thousand of your
  fellow creatures groan beneath the lash of unfeeling tyrants, under the flag
  of a nation professing to be guided by the law of Liberty, and Equal Rights!
  Have you not professed to the world, that “ALL MEN ARE BORN FREE AND EQUAL.”
  Is not this mockery? Are not these very letters shaded by the crimson blood of
  your suffering brethren? Or
  <em>are not</em>
  Africans men? Tyrant, does not your bleeding slave while kneeling to you for
  mercy, address you in the language of human nature—and do not
  <em>you</em>
  prove yourself incapable of appreciating that language? ‘Tis
  <em>you</em>
  who seem less than a man, and most devoid of every principle, every attribute
  of humanity.

  One miserable refuge, behind which the slave-holder retreats, is this; that
  many slaves are very well satisfied with their situation and would not wish to
  change it!” Very fine indeed! Because you have reduced them to this abject
  dependence, and perverted all the noble independence of their nature, you have
  a right to trample upon their undeniable rights, and continue the iniquitous
  business! Because a blind man loves the taste of arsenic, (being ignorant of
  its deadly tendency) you will thrust it down his throat! From what must that
  contentedness arise, which induces the slave to embrace the scourge and hub
  the fetter. Would
  <em>you</em>
  be content to drudge for a master, and crouch at his feet like a dog? You say
  “death before slavery,” and you would despise a white man who would submit to
  the degradation of unlimited subordination. Because a wretch who is weary of
  life requests you to shoot him, would you be justified in blowing his brains
  out with a pistol? Answer these questions ye advocates for slavery, and if
  “custom has not steeled your hearts” to every principle of rectitude, you will
  see that mercy to a negro entitles you to no praise, since he has the same
  claim to liberty and respect as a European.

<p align=""right"">CATO.</p>
"	Black male writer	This letter represents the most mportant local Black male voice in the pages of <em>The Unionist</em>. As was the case in the trial transcripts, a Black history lesson is embedded in the frequent use of "Cato" as a pen name. During the time of the American Revolution, the white founding fathers specifically wanted to shape the new government like that of the Roman Republic, not the Roman Empire. Hence they preferred the mythos of Cato - exemplifying moral courage and integrity - to that of Caesar's power grab. African-Americans, of course, found the white emphasis on liberty both puzzling - given the continued presence of slavery - and an opportunity to use this now-public rhetoric. Thus, as you can see in the illustration accompanying this entry, one of the most famous African-American petitions of the Revolutionary era came from "Cato" - a poor Black whose emancipation was in danger from an attempt to repeal a law granting liberty. Written in 1781, Cato's petition was well-known in the Black community.	William Cowper

  MR EDITOR,—I was pleased to notice the account of the “training” which
  appeared in your columns of last week. I have often wondered that a system so
  useless—(to say nothing of its pernicious influence on public morals) and so
  evidently unpopular among the people should so generally have escaped the
  censure of the press.
</p>
<p>
  The evils attendant on the training system are great—
  <em>they are felt in this community,</em>
  and ought to be exposed by every friend of justice and by every lover of good
  order in society.—I rejoice to perceive that you understand the best mode of
  treating the subject. Sound and sober argument will have no influence with
  those who advocate the present miserable system of militia trainings. Ridicule
  has done more to bring about a reform in this system than all the arguments
  that have ever been urged against it.
</p>
<p>
  As it is the professed object of your paper to promote the cause of justice
  and of sound morals it is to be hoped you will not let this subject drop. You
  will be sustained by this community, and by exposing the unequal operations of
  the militia law, its uselessness, &amp; its pernicious consequences, you will
  merit and receive the thanks of the
  people.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  W.
</p>
<p>
  P.S. I am obliged to you Mr Editor, for the definition of the term
  “spirit-stirring-drum.” There are some other terms in the soldiers vocabulary
  that require a satisfactory explanation.
</p>
<p></p>
"	It is significant that the letter writers all have to use pseudonmys. Not an uncommon practice, but potentially indicates community hostility.	This letter from "W." concerns militia training laws. Apparently a critique of these militia training laws had been included in <em>The Unionist</em> issue of August 29, 1833 (1:5). This now-missing article also included a critique of the "spirit-stirring-drum." These ideas are congruent with Jonathan Dymond's anti-war writings.
Charles Burleigh's commentary on the First Trial	The Unionist	Black Law; Prudence Crandall; Journalistic Debate	"We are told in the last Advertiser, that the counsel for Miss Crandall in the
recent trial, “spoke like men who were paid for it,” but that Messrs. Judson and
Welch “spoke
<em>“con amore.”</em>
If Messrs. Ellsworth and Strong argue so powerfully and conclusively merely for
pay, what, we may well ask,
<em>would they do</em>
if they should speak
<em>“con amore.</em>
” We have no wish to underrate the merits of the counsel for the prosecution; we
doubt not they did their best. The gentleman who closed we would allude to in
particular as having displayed ability and ingenuity worthy of a better cause.
True we could not but think he in some instances approached nearer to coarsness
[sic] and vulgarity than was altogether seemly under existing circumstances, but
considering he was “trammeled by a bad cause,” he certainly acquitted himself
very creditably. But were we desirous of eulogizing him and his colleague, we
would not accuse them of arguing such a cause
<em>“con amore”</em>
or represent them as having on that occasion exhibited “logical precision, and
elegance of language unusual even to themselves.”

Charles Burleigh compares Fall River and Canterbury	The Unionist	Black Law; Journalistic Debate	"<p>
  We feel it our duty to make the fact public, that one of the jury refused to
  listen to any remonstrance from his brother jurors, because the ‘law,’ the
  constitutionality of which, he was called on to decide, was ‘Judson’s Law!!’—
  <em>Advertiser.</em>
</p>
<p>
  “We feel it
  <em>our</em>
  duty” to say in reference to the above, that we have conversed with one of the
  jurors, who informs us that he heard nothing said about the law, being
  ‘Judson’s law,’ or the “black law,” or the “Canterbury Law,” and that no
  disinclination was manifested to hear remonstrance or to listen to reason, and
  no disposition to take into consideration in making up the decision, anything
  but the law and the constitution, and the facts proved, unless the exception
  be found in an attempt of one juror to make the bad tendency of an acquittal,
  an argument for conviction. And “we feel it our duty” too, to remind the
  Advertiser of the reproofs he has, not many months since bestowed upon the
  Fall River Monitor for not quietly acquiescing in the result of a fair trial
  by a jury of the country. Oh! the beauty of consistency!
</p>
"		"Burleigh's reference to Fall River concerns the infamous Ephraim Avery trial, in which a Methodist minister was accused of the murder of a young female parishioner with whom, it was speculated, he had been having an affair. He was acquitted, but the case remained a major controversy. In the Wikipedia article on the incident - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephraim_Kingsbury_Avery""> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephraim_Kingsbury_Avery</a> -there are at least three full-length studies cited in the bibliography

Commentary on School for African-American Girls in New Haven	The Unionist	Abolition; Black Law; Journalistic Debate; Education	"The Advertiser man doubts the correctness of our statement in reference to the
school for colored females in New Haven. If he were only as anxious to keep his
own columns free from misstatements, as he is to find errors in ours, we should
less frequently be under the unpleasant necessity of pointing out his departures
from truth. As to the school in New-Haven, we have only to say that our
information was derived from Mr. Tappan, and that Mr. Francis Robinson of Yale
College, (now in this town on a visit to his parents) confirms the statement.

Character of the Dutch	The Unionist	Miscellaneous Filler	"<em>Character of the Dutch,</em>
—It is well known that a habit prevails almost every where, of underrating and disparaging Dutch character and Dutchmen. Nothing is more unjust, and nothing is
more common—nothing testifies more unequivocally the ignorance and prejudice of
those who indulge in it, than the habit.—England is called the mother; but if
such of our population, whose ancestors emigrated from her shores are proud of
their origin, much more reason have they, who are descendants of the honest
burgomasters of Holland, to be proud of theirs.—Holland, though occupying a
territory not larger than the state of Maryland, was first among the nations of
Europe to take a stand in favor of liberty, and, single handed, maintained a six
years’ war in its defence, against the greatest odds. At a time when France and
England were yet involved in bigotry and superstition, Holland achieved for
herself civil and religious freedom, and opened her bosom as an asylum for the
oppressed Huguenots; while others, the pilgrim fathers sought a refuge from
persecution in the wilds of America. Holland for a long time took the lead of
all the surrounding nations in commerce, in science, in arts, and in arms. For
the inventions of the telescope, microscope, thermometer, pendulum, gunpowder,
and printing, the world is indebted to the Dutch. And the best and most correct
translation of the original Scriptures, in any language, is that of the Low
Dutch, made under the auspices of the Synod of Dort.
"		In what could be a sly parallel to racial prejudice, the historic contributions of the Dutch are positively evaluated. The Synod of Dort was the Calvinistic theological gathering that cemented the TULIP doctrine of total human depravity.

prisoner carrying a child, which was crying, and seemed very reluctant to be
taken away. The gentlemen stopped Hill, and questioned him as to how he came in
possession of the child. He gave them evasive answers, and they then inquired of
the child where she lived. The little girl told them her place of residence, and
signified her entire ignorance of the cause for which Hill had taken her away.
The gentlemen considered the case sufficiently suspicious to warrant them in
arresting the prisoner, and one of them, assisted by a man of color, named
Bristol Martin, lodged him in prison, whilst the other restored the little girl
to her friends. Hill’s explanation of the affair was, that he merely took the
child to <em>give it some candy</em>. He had been seen the same evening endeavoring to take away another child, who,
however, struggled so hard as to make him abandon his design. The occurrence
created considerable excitement amongst the people of color in the city, a large
number of whom attended to hear the case disposed of. Hill was committed to
prison.—

  <em>The Holy Bible in Canton.</em>
  —A second edition of the Bible has been published at the Anglo Chinese
  College, in Malacca; it is a large and beautiful octavo in 21 volumes, and has
  been printed with new blocks. Had the College been the means of accomplishing
  nothing more than the publication of this and a former edition of the Bible,
  we should think its founder and contributors abundantly repaid for all their
  labors. But we know from good authority, that many of the students who have
  been educated in the college, are now filling respectable stations, civil or
  commercial in the Straits; and that some of them are teaching the English
  language in Pegu and Cochin China. And above all we rejoice to know that some
  have there received the gospel in the love of it; obey its precepts; enjoy its
  consolations; and assist, even in China itself, in diffusing a knowledge of
  its righteous requisites and its glorious promises.

Ten miles of Paper	The Unionist	Miscellaneous Filler; Science	"<em>Ten miles of Paper.</em>
—Paper used to be sold by the sheet, the quire, or the ream;&nbsp; but in “the
march of improvement,” stationary will not remain stationary, and so it is now
sold by measure. The following order was received from a pottery firm the other
day. The writer, it will be observed, gives his orders with as much indifference
as though they were not at all extraordinary:—“Gentlemen—Please to send us ten
miles of your best printing tissue paper, in length; 6 miles to be 30 inches
broad, 4 miles 22 inches broad—to be wrapped on wooden rollers, according to the
plan given to Mr. George Fourdrinier.” The object of having the paper of such
great length is that it may be printed from engraved cylinders, in the same way
as calicoes, &amp;c.

U.S. Deposits	The Unionist	National News; Miscellaneous Filler	"<p>
  <em>U.S. Deposits.</em>
  —A writer in the Boston Daily Advertiser, who is evidently familiar with
  banking operations, shows by mathematical demonstration, that “The Government
  deposits, cannot be removed from the Bank of the United States, because there
  is no local Bank strong enough to take them, burthened as such a duty is with
  the obligation, on the part of such local Bank, to receive the bills of all
  the branches of the Bank of the United States and to pay out Gold and Silver,
  for the checks of the Government.” It is also stated that the proposed removal
  is illegal, and not within the power of the Executive.
</p>
<p>The New York Commercial Advertiser contains the following paragraph:—</p>
<p>
  “Of one thing we feel very strongly assured, and we wish well what we say. No
  matter what terms or conditions are offered by the local banks—
  <em>the deposits will not be removed.</em>
  And further: No matter for the sentiments or the vetoes of the President,
  <em>the Charter of the Bank will one day be renewed.”</em>
</p>

"		The political and economic crisis that preoccupied Andrew Jackson's second term as President was the controversy over the charter of The Bank of the United States. <em>The Unionist</em> predictably stood by the Bank against President Jackson, a perspective that was amplified when William Burleigh joined the editorial team by the end of 1833.

and it was necessary to have the goods in Manchester the next day before one to
go by the Rail Road to Liverpool. Mr. Alsop who is at the head of Mr. Lockett’s

—“The Rev. Calvin Colton has written a book entitled ‘The Americans,’ in which
he gives a deserved castigation to Capt. Basil Hall, Mrs. Trollope, and the
English Reviewers. This work, which is said to be a very clever performance,
coming on the back of Mr. Stuart’s, will pretty well settle the question with
these traducers of American character and manners.
"		This book, <em>The Americans, by an American in London</em>, by Calvin Colton (1789-1857), can be found in a [Hathitrust digitization.] (https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=yale.39002007679153&view=1up&seq=7&q1=american%20colonization%20society)  It is unlikely that Burleigh had read it, as it contains support for the American Colonization Society, which he would not have endorsed.  In this 1833 book, Colton sees both the impracticality of the American Colonization Society's project, and the evil of slavery, but still thinks that the Colonization Society is a benevolent organization that is gradually raising consciousness around the issue of slavery. When he returned to the United States in 1835, though, he became a strident anti-abolitionist, even writing a piece titled <em>Abolition, a Sedition</em> in 1839.

Miss Crandall's Second Trial	The Unionist	Black Law; Prudence Crandall; Canterbury Female Academy; African-American Students	"<p>From the Brooklyn Unionist, October 10</p>
<p>MISS CRANDALL’S SECOND TRIAL.</p>
<p>
  Last Thursday Miss Crandall was brought before the Superior Court sitting in
  this place, (Judge Daggett on the bench,) upon an information similar to that
  on which she was tried at the last session of the County Court. She had been
  bound over to answer to two complaints, one for teaching, and the other for
  boarding colored persons from other states., but was tried on the former only.
  A.T. Judson, Esq. and C.F. Cleaveland, the State’s Attorney, conducted the
  prosecution, Henry Strong, Esq. and Hon. Calvin Goddard the defence. The plea
  as on the former trial was <em>not guilty.</em>
  Several witnesses were examined, the facts necessary to conviction were
  proved, and nothing remained but to establish the constitutionality of the
  law.
</p>
<p>
  Mr. Judson opened the case for the prosecution and pursued much the same train
  of argument as on the former trial, except that in addition to the points then
  made, he contended that the clause in the constitution which was made the
  ground of the defence, was intended as a rule of action to the general
  government only, and not to the State Legislatures. He was followed by Mr.
  Strong, who, in a powerful, logical and conclusive argument, clearly exhibited
  the unconstitutionality of the law, showing that the Constitution
  <em>was</em> made to control the action of the state Legislatures; that it was intended to
  secure to all citizens of the United States, the enjoyment of such privileges
  and immunities as are fundamental; that the privilege of obtaining an
  education is fundamental; and that free blacks are citizens, and of course
  entitled, though citizens of other states, to the same privileges as our own
  colored population, and among others to that of acquiring knowledge here. Mr.
  Goddard closed for the defence, briefly but eloquently, and the State’s
  Attorney having concluded on the part of the prosecution, the judge rose and
  saying a few words respecting the importance of the question, and his
  inability to do it justice, declined giving his charge till the next morning.
</p>
<p>
  On Friday morning as soon as the court was opened every seat was occupied and
  many persons stood unable to obtain seats, all listening with profound
  attention to the charge. It occupied as nearly as we could estimate, about an
  hour, and as will be seen by the outline given below was decidedly in favor of
  the constitutionality of the law.
</p>

  After stating to the Jury the charge on which Miss Crandall was brought before
  them, His Honor Judge Daggett proceeded: “In relation to the facts there does
  not appear to be much controversy—it is your province however to decide
  whether they have been proved. It is also your province to decide as to the
  law, the court cannot direct you as to either. But it is the duty of the court
  to advise you in respect to the law.
</p>
<p>
  It is claimed that the law under which this prosecution is instituted, is
  unconstitutional. If it be, it is because it violates the constitution
  of the United States, for it is not violation of the constitution of
  Connecticut. The question then is, Does this law violate the constitution of
  the United States? If a law is clearly unconstitutional, it is the duty of the
  humblest court in the land, even a justice of the peace, so to pronounce it,
  for all judges, under which name are included jurors when acting as judges,
  are bound by the constitution or laws in the respective states to the contrary
  notwithstanding.
</p>
<p>
  In considering the question, “Is this law unconstitutional,” you will lay out
  of consideration all extrinsic matter, slavery, and all its enormous evils;
  the degradation of the blacks, and the utility and necessity of their being
  educated, except so far as it is necessary to determine whether the privilege
  of education is fundamental, of which I have no doubt.
</p>
<p>There are two points to be considered.</p>
<p>
  1
  <sup>st</sup>
  . The constitution secures to all citizens of the U.S. the privileges and
  immunities of citizens in the several states. The construction of this section
  <em>is not,</em>
  as was contended at the bar, that it regulates only the action of the general
  Government: it is operative as well upon the state Legislature as upon
  Congress.
</p>
<p>
  2
  <sup>nd</sup>
  . Are the persons affected by this law, citizens of the United States. The law
  prohibits colored persons from Havana coming here, as well as the blacks of
  other states. With respect to the former, the right of exclusion is
  unquestionable, for they are not citizens of the United States. Are the
  colored inhabitants of this country citizens? It is the opinion of this court
  that they are not. Are slaves citizens of the United States? The constitution
  recognizes them only as the basis of representation and taxation. I refer to
  the definition of the word citizen as given by Mr. Webster, the ablest
  philologist of this or any country. (The judge here read the several
  definitions of the word as given in Webster’s dictionary, the last of which,
  and the only one applicable to the case is as follows—“In the United States, a
  person, native or naturalized, who has the privilege of exercising the
  elective franchise, and of purchasing and holding real estate.”) Slaves, then,
  are not citizens, in any of the state constitutions. Are Indians citizens? It
  is difficult to say what they are, but they are not citizens. Kent, in his
  commentaries, speaks of them as distinct tribes, living under the protection
  of the government,—2 Kent, 70. Are the free people of color citizens? I
  answer, No. They are not so styled in the Constitution of the United States,
  or, so far as I am aware, in the laws of Congress or of any of the states. In
  that clause of the constitution which fixes the basis of representation, there
  was an opportunity to have called them citizens if they were so considered.
  But that makes free
  <em>persons</em>
  (adding three fifths of all other persons,) the basis of representation and
  taxation..
</p>
<p>
  It has been said that free blacks own vessels which participate in the
  peculiar privileges of American shipping. But this claim has never been
  settled by judicial decisions. I know of no case where this question has been
  settled. It is said also that blacks may sue in the U.S. Courts, but this too,
  has never, within my knowledge been decided. It is claimed that they are
  citizens because they may be guilty of treason, but so may any person who
  resides under the government and enjoys its protection, if he rises up against
  it.
</p>
<p>
  [His honor then read from Kent’s commentaries II, 210 a note in which the
  commentator speaks of the degraded condition of the blacks and the
  disabilities under which they labor, and thence inferred that in Kent’s
  opinion they were not citizens.]
</p>
<p>
  Another reason for believing that people of color were not considered
  citizens, is found in the fact that when the United States Constitution was
  adopted every state except Massachusetts, tolerated slavery. The slave laws of
  New-York were as severe as those of any state in the Union. In 1740 a slave in
  that state was convicted by three justices and jury of five, and burnt at the
  stake. God forbid that I should add to the degradation of this people, by
  stating these things, but such is our condition.
</p>
<p>
  But if free blacks are citizens I am not prepared to say that the law is
  <em>unconstitutional,</em> though on this point I have more doubts than on the other. The constitution of
  the United States did not profess to vest in the State Legislatures any new
  powers, but to abridge those already possessed. I see not but the Legislature,
  under their general power, might pass this law, I say nothing of its justice
  or injustice, for I do not stand here to justify or abuse the legislature
  which passed it. If the people disapprove the law, let them choose better men
  to represent them who will repeal it. The privilege of acquiring an education
  is certainly a fundamental privilege, but I am of opinion that the Legislature
  may regulate it.
</p>
<p>
  The jury went out, and after an absence of 20 or 30 minutes returned with a
  verdict of GUILTY.

  “In the Brooklyn Unionist, Oct. 10
  <sup>th</sup>
  , we find an account of a second trial of Miss Crandall before the Superior Court of Connecticut, Judge Daggett on the bench. The charge on which she was
  tried was for teaching colored people from other states. The Judge instructed
  the jury that free people of color are not citizens, and that the law of
  Connecticut is, therefore, not unconstitutional. The jury went out and after
  an absence of 20 or 30 minutes, returned with a verdict of guilty. A bill of
  exceptions was filed and the case put over to the Supreme Court of Errors, to
  be holden at Brooklyn next July.
</p>
<p>
  On this singular decision we remark that if the case be so that free colored
  people are not citizens of the United States, their condition is far worse
  than we had supposed. But we cannot believe this, the arguments in the decision
  notwithstanding; and we cannot account for it that such a decision comes from
  Judge Daggett, except on the supposition that strong feeling, excited in his
  native place (New Haven), by an attempt to erect a similar school there some
  time ago, has biased his judgment.
</p>
<p>Judge Daggett says</p>
<p>
  ‘Are the colored inhabitants of this country citizens? It is the opinion of
  this court that they are not. Are slaves citizens of the U.S.? The
  constitution recognizes them only as the basis of representation and taxation.
  I refer to the definition of the word citizen as given by Mr. Webster, the
  ablest philologist of this or any country. (The judge here read the several
  definitions of the word as given in Webster’s dictionary, the last of which,
  and the only one applicable to the case is as follows—“In the United States, a
  person, native or naturalized, who has the privilege of exercising the
  elective franchise, and of purchasing and holding real estate.”) Slaves, then,
  are not citizens, in any of the state constitutions. Are Indians citizens? It
  is difficult to say what they are, but they are not citizens. Kent, in his
  commentaries, speaks of them as distinct tribes, living under the protection
  of the government,—2 Kent, 70. Are the free people of color citizens? I
  answer, No. They are not so styled in the Constitution of the United States,
  or, so far as I am aware, in the laws of Congress or of any of the states. In
  that clause of the constitution which fixes the basis of representation, there
  was an opportunity to have called them citizens if they were so considered.
  But that makes free <em>persons</em> (adding three fifths of all other persons,) the basis of representation and
  taxation.”
</p>
<p>
  “They” (the free people of color) are not so styled (citizens) in the
  constitution of the United States.” What then? is it not implied? The
  constitution does not so style free <em>white</em> persons, but does it not imply as much? Again, “In that clause which fixes the
  basis of representation, there was an opportunity to have called them citizens
  if they were so considered.” And so there was an opportunity to have called
  free white people citizens. If the omission excludes the one from citizenship,
  why not the other “But that (the constitution) makes free
  <em>persons</em>
  (adding three fifths of all other persons) the basis of representation and
  taxation.” Now it seems to us that only two classes are here spoken of; first,
  free persons, who, absolutely, form a basis, and next, slaves, only three
  fifths of which form a basis. If then, the characteristic of forming a basis
  for representation and taxation, entire, without division (five fifths of a
  man and not three fifths) constitutes citizenship, by what logic is it
  inferred that
  <em>free</em>
  colored persons are not citizens? The constitution it is true says nothing
  about complexion, but does the omission therefore exclude free colored persons
  If so can any one tell why it does not exclude free white persons?
</p>
<p>
  Judge Daggett says, “another reason for believing that people of color were
  not considered citizens is found in the fact that when the United States
  constitution was adopted, every state except Massachusetts, tolerated
  slavery.” We are dull—we do not see how this related to the point in question.
</p>
<p>
  It was argued in the Court, that free blacks own vessels which participate in
  the peculiar privileges of American shipping, and that blacks may sue in the
  United States courts. This was overruled on the ground that those points had
  never been settled by judicial decisions. We suppose it is true that free
  colored people have owned vessels, and participated in the peculiar privileges
  of American shipping ever since the constitution was formed, that they have
  also had suits in the U.S. Courts, and that they have received protections as
  American Citizens from British impressment. And it seems incredible that this
  should have gone of 57 years, unquestioned, if they were not in reality
  American citizens.
</p>
<p>
  What aid the definition of Webster gives to the decision we do not see. “In
  the United States (a citizen is) a person, native or naturalized, who has the
  privilege of exercising the elective franchise, and of purchasing and holding
  real estate.” Now in seven states the persons in question have the right of
  the elective franchise, and in all the right of purchasing and holding
  realestate. Does not the definition then make against the decision rather than
  for it?
</p>
<p>
  In this decision also Judge Daggett has gone in the face of very high opinion.
  In the Convention of New York for amending the constitution, on the motion to
  insert the word
  <em>white</em>
  before the words “
  <em>male citizens,”</em>
  in the article relating to the right of suffrage, Peter A. Jay said, “Is not
  the right of suffrage a privilege? Can you deny it to a
  <em>citizen</em>
  of Pennsylvania, who comes here and complies with your laws, merely because he
  is not six feet high, or because he is of a dark complexion?’ Chancellor Kent
  said.
</p>
<p>
  “Suppose a
  <em>negro</em>
  owning a freehold, and entitled to vote in Vermont, removes to this state, can
  we constitutionally exclude him from the privilege of voting? The constitution
  of the United States provides that
  <em>citizens</em>
  of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of
  citizens of the several States.”
</p>
<p>Rufus King said</p>
<p>
  ‘Take the fact that a
  <em>citizen of color</em>
  entitled to all the privileges of a citizen, comes here—he purchases a
  freehold—can you deny him the rights of an elector incident to his freehold?
  He is entitled to vote because like
  <em>any other citizen</em>
  he is a freeholder, and ever freeholder your laws entitle to vote.’
</p>
<p>And again,</p>
<p>
  “
  <em>
    As certainly as the children of any white men are citizen, so certainly the
    children of black men are citizens.”
  </em>
</p>
<p>Abram Van Vechten said,</p>
<p>
  ‘There is another and to my mind an insuperable objection to the exclusion of
  free citizens of color from the right of suffrage, arising from the provision
  of the Constitution of the U.S. that the citizens of each State shall be
  entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several
  States.’
</p>
<p>
  In 1826 De Witt Clinton demanded of President Adams the release of ‘Gilbert
  Horton a free man of color and a citizen of this state’ (New York) unlawfully
  imprisoned in the District of Columbia, on the ground that he was ‘a free man
  and a citizen.’
</p>
<p>
  We cannot believe with Judge Daggett that the whole free colored population
  of our country is outlawed, that emancipation confers as privilege but that of
  rambling about. And we hope there is a higher appeal yet than the Supreme
  Court of blinded Connecticut before which this case may be tried. We believe
  the people of Canterbury and their abettors are heaping up for themselves a
  load of odium, which they will find it difficult to bear.”

  “Judge Daggett.—This respected magistrate, we perceive, was not compelled, as we supposed, to sentence a Christian sister to an infamous punishment for the crime of teaching other Christian sisters the knowledge by which they could be qualified to do good to their class. The case was carried directly to the Court of Errors. The Hon. Judge, in giving his opinion in favor of the
  <em>constitutionality</em>
  of the “Black law” did not, as we learn by a private letter, commit himself to
  any opinion in favor of the law itself.
</p>
<p>
  The question of constitutionality turned mainly upon this point, whether the
  persons affected by the law are <em>citizens</em> of the United States. The judge relied on the definition in Webster, that
  citizens are those who enjoy the elective franchise, and can hold real estate,
  and it has never been judicially decided that blacks can do this, or sue in
  the United States Courts. A writer in the “Unionist,” who seems to have
  examined the subject, shows that the right of suffrage may be exercised in
  New-Hampshire by male <em>inhabitants;</em>
  in Vt. by a <em>man;</em> in Mass. by male
  <em>citizens;</em>
  (under which term blacks have always voted, and one has held a seat as
  representative,) in R. I. by a <em>subject;</em>
  in N.Y. blacks of certain qualifications can vote; in Pa. every
  <em>freeman,</em> and the same in N.C. and Tenn. The constitutions of Md., Va. N.C. Ky. Ala.
  Miss. Mo. And Lou. limit the right of voting to free <em>white</em> citizens, which would be superfluous unless blacks may be citizens. The same
  number of the Unionist contains extracts from speeches delivered in the
  convention of New-York, 1821, by such men as Peter A. Jay,  James Kent, Rufus
  King, Abraham Van Vechten, all maintaining expressly that people of color are
  citizens. Also a letter from De Witt Clinton to President Adams in 1826,

  that a

  Sir,—I have the honor to enclose copies of the proceedings of a&nbsp;
  respectable meeting in West Chester County in the State, and of an Affidavit
  of John Owen, by which it appears that one Gilbert Horton, a free man of color
  <em>and a citizen of this State</em>
  is unlawfully imprisoned in the jail of the city of Washington, and is
  advertised to be sold by the Marshal of the District of Columbia. From
  whatever authority a law authorizing such proceedings may have emanated,
  whether from the municipality of Washington, the Legislature of Maryland, or
  the Congress of the United States, it is at least void and unconstitutional in
  its application to a
  <em>citizen,</em>
  and could never have intended to extend further than to fugitive slaves. As
  the District of Columbia is under the exclusive control of the National
  Government I conceive it my duty to apply to you for the liberation of Gilbert
  Horton as a freeman,
  <em>and a citizen,</em>
  and feel persuaded that this request will be followed by immediate relief.

  “We have copied on our last page, from the Brooklyn (Conn.) Unionist, a report
  of the trial of Miss Crandall with the charge of Judge Daggett. It will be
  seen that Judge D. has given it as his opinion, that no colored man is a
  citizen of the United States. This opinion, we are sure, will be viewed with
  astonishment in many parts of the Union. In Massachusetts, the constitution
  and laws have never deprived any man of any privilege on account of the color
  of his skin. The black man there votes, buys and sells real estate, and is
  eligible to the office of Judge, Senator, or Governor. The same is true of
  Maine, and we believe also of Vermont, New Hampshire, and several other
  States. In Connecticut and New York, it is true, the laws are not equally
  creditable to the humanity and republicanism of the people; and in most of the
  states farther south, there are distinctions between different classes of the
  population still more opposed to sound moral and political principle, but we
  believe that Judge D. is the first judge in the United States who has
  officially expressed the opinion, that free colored men are not citizens. We
  cannot believe that this is sound law, and we are supported in this belief by
  some of the ablest jurists in our country, whose opinions we quote below.
</p>
<p>
  While we are on this subject we must caution our foreign friends not to make
  too wide an application of the censure which they may found on the proceedings
  in the case of Miss Crandall. So far as we have noticed, those proceedings,
  beyond the limits of Connecticut, are everywhere viewed with marked
  disapprobation. We regard them as the offspring of a delusion similar to that
  which pervades Georgia in relation to the Cherokees. It is local, and we trust
  it will be temporary.
</p>

  The opinions of the jurists referred to above, are contained in the following
  extracts from “Reports of the proceedings and debates of the Convention of
  1821, assembled for the purpose of amending the Constitution of the State of

and designs of the abolitionists, and we find little to modify and nothing to
retract. To the charge of severity and injustice towards the characters of the
leaders in this crusade, we reply—
<em>Physician heal thyselfˆ–</em>
clear your own eyes of motes and films before you proceed to pull out beams from
the eyes of others. The whole vocabulary of abuse and contumely has been
exhausted by the abolitionists in their attempts to defame the motives and
blacken the characters of the members of the Colonization society—so that now we
scarcely see aught else in the columns of the Liberator and Emancipator, but
numerous repetitions of the same false and unfounded charges. Indeed, one would
think, from the matter contained in those papers, that their
<em>sole</em>
object is to destroy the Colonization society; as if that being accomplished,
every thing else was easy. Now let the merits of abolitionism be ten times what
its warmest abettors assert, no reasonable objection can be made to the
Colonization Society whatever. It proposes to transport free blacks to Africa
with their own consent, and if the blacks are willing to go, pray may not
<em>free white</em>
men give their money for the purpose without asking the consent of the President
of the Anti-Slavery Society? Where was the kindness and charity of Garrison, yea
more, where was his regard for moral probity, when he said that his object in
going to England was to raise funds for the establishment of a manual labor
school—and now, since his return, he acknowledges that he was induced to the
voyage by a desire to represent (misrepresent he should have said) the object
and designs of the Colonization Society to the English. That he slandered his
countrymen in London, there is abundant proof. Since he returned, he denies
it—so that no less than four falsehoods lie at his door, without the possibility
of any good accruing from either. How much was there “of the law of kindness as
well as of the requisitions of justice” in the latter which the patron of the
Unionist wrote to some students, and which he requested might be published; when
he said that he looked upon the Colonization Society
<em>in no other light than an emissary of Satan</em>
—whose only object is to perpetuate slavery? And who have been more frequently
accused of falsehood and misrepresentation than Rev. Mr. Gurley and Mr. Finley?
We do not ask these questions to justify ourselves if we have done wrong, but
merely to, let our “brother” see that it ill becomes him to throw stones. Till
he &amp; his sect are free from sin they should be slow in condemning others. As
to what we asserted concerning the leaders in the abolition enterprize, we deem
it strictly true. When they are told that the constitution forbids the free
states from meddling with property at the south, they reply in the language of
the Apostle to the Jewish Ruler—we must obey God and not man—thus asserting
their independence of the laws under which we live. If they respect the laws,
why does not Miss Crandall dismiss her school? Till the decision of Judge Dagget
is over ruled, that decision is the law of the land, which every honest citizen
is bound to respect—and yet we see the Genius of Temperance, (the Editors of
which call themselves Christians par excellence) encouraging her to continue in
opposition to a decree of one of the highest tribunals in the state. We find the
abolitionists endeavoring to cast contempt upon the Colonization Society,
because the latter speak of what is expedient to be done, in opposition to the
designs of the&nbsp; former—and meeting in the writings of a gentleman of
talents and learning, a quotation about expediency being “a wrap-rascal,”
they have rung the charges upon it, till it has fairly become stale, not
forgetting in the excess of their charity to insinuate that whoever may doubt of
the expediency of a measure, there can be no question as to the character which
such person&nbsp; should sustain in their own immaculate conceptions. Did these
over scrupulous gentlemen every hear or read of one who said that “all things
are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient.” In the present state of
the country immediate and unconditional abolition is neither
<em>expedient</em>
nor
<em>lawful</em>
—and those engaged in promoting it are only planting the seeds of sedition. Let
them beware that in sowing the wind, they do not reap the whirlwind.

  DEAR SIR—The following, which was received through the Post Office a few days
  since, may be published in the Liberator, if you think proper. We wish to have
  it come before the public in order to show the opposition of certain white
  people to the education of their colored brethren. The letter is given, word

  with this

</p>
<p>
  An explanation of the foregoing may not be out of place, and will place the
  subject in a stronger light before your readers. It is well known to those who
  have perused the Liberator during the past year, from the facts given in the
  2d No.,of the present volume, that a colored man of the name of Ray was
  formerly a student in the Wesleyan University, and that he was under the
  necessity of leaving it (the university) on account of the prejudices of
  certain students. We are informed that the person who sent letters to the
  Liberator, which he had received relative to Mr Ray’s leaving, incurred the
  severest displeasure of those prejudiced students. It is probably known that
  he was not then a member of the university. The excitement however soon passed
  away, and in the course of a few months he entered the university. As the
  subject of the above letter wished to pursue certain studies, instruction was
  given him in that student’s room. Mr Beman recited three times each week, and
  for a considerable time was unmolested other than by the reproachful terms of
  a few base fellows as he passed to and fro from his recitation. His conduct
  towards others was ever such as to merit a gentlemanlike deportment from them,
  but this he did not receive. When those disaffected students found that
  reproaches did not deter him from pursuing his course of recitations, they
  resorted to other means. In going out from the university on a certain
  morning, a quantity of water was thrown upon him, by which he was
  <em>completely drenched.</em>
  Some time in the course of the next day one of the party interested in the
  affair caused a notice to be put up, calling a meeting of the students, that
  evening, the spirit of which was such as to lead many to think it was written
  by one not unfriendly to Mr Beman. This trick however was discovered, and
  exposed at the meeting before mentioned. When the meeting was opened, that
  <em>very person</em>
  who wrote the notice, and who, there is strong reason to believe, was
  concerned in insulting Mr Beman, rose and
  <em>
    offered a resolution disapproving the conduct of those engaged in that
    affair.
  </em>
  After the subject before the meeting had been with much warmth discussed, and
  a request having been made that the student who then instructed Mr B. would
  hear him recite at some other place, the meeting was dissolved. &nbsp;This
  request, for the sake of producing harmony among the students, was, in form,
  complied with, but owing to the subsequent advice of some friends, the
  recitation went on as before, till the college vacation. Since the
  Commencement, for the convenience of him who is instructing Mr B, the
  recitation has not been heard in the university. All went on very well till
  this letter was received, which has produced much excitement and unpleasant
  feeling. It will not prevent the instruction that may be desired however.
</p>
<p>
  In this letter there is one thing not very consistent, and, to a certain
  extent, unaccountable; that is, that such a request and such a threat should
  be made when the subject of it does not recite in the university. It may be
  that there are certain ones who are unwilling that the colored people should
  be educated in any way whatever, and are endeavoring to drive those who may
  wish to pursue any course of study from their places of instruction. But we
  feel thankful that the
  <em>‘Canterbury law’</em>
  has no effect in this case, for the subject is not a
  <em>‘foreigner.’</em>

</p>
<p>
  The foregoing facts may be relied on, for we have received them from those who
  are immediately acquainted with the circumstances.

"	Check the Emancipator for their republication date	This article contains a request for The Unionist to republish this article. Given the proximity between Canterbury and Middletown, The Unionist was the closest Abolitionist newspaper. If The Unionist republished this article, it would most likely have been in the November 6, 1833 issue	Amos Beman
The Norwich <em>Courier</em> Upbraids <em>The Unionist</em>	<em>Norwich Courier</em>	Journalistic Debate; The Unionist; Abolition; Prudence Crandall	"<p>
  “If the Unionist is determined not to understand, but to misconceive, we
  cannot be responsible. If we have been “unjust,” we are ready to make
  amends—but the “severity” must in all probability be laid at the door of
  truth, and the latter will take care of herself. All that we have to say is,
  that we have not wittingly “misrepresented” any body. We have spoken of the
  abolitionists with freedom, and shall do it again. Their designs are of a
  character that do not require that we should be very mincing in our words, or
  exceeding choice of our language. We mean, at all times, that it shall be
  decent and respectful, for the sake of the public—but we are not aware of any
  peculiar obligation that we are under to suit our phrases to the holiday
  conceptions of those from whom we differ. We disclaimed, expressly, the
  justice of retorting railing for tailing, and yet the Unionist suppresses the
  disclaimer totally, and
  <em>yet treats us as if we justified it.</em>
  This is a specimen, we presume, of abolitionist propriety. The Unionist says—
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    “We do not wish the free states to ‘meddle with property at the south,” or
    to interfere in any shape or form, with slavery at the south, except by
    legal and constitutional methods. Our only meddling is such as almost all
    the papers in the land have been guilty of, whenever they have denounced
    Russian tyranny, or sympathized with Polish patriots suffering under
    imperial despotism. In short the only meddling of which we are, or wish to be
    guilty, is the utterance of the truth, the exposure of the evils and guilt
    of slavery, the asserting and proving that its abolition will be for the
    good of all parties concerned, the petitioning Congress for its abolition in
    those parts of the country which are under the exclusive jurisdiction of the
    General Government.”
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Thus pray what is the use of your keeping up this constant agitation at the
  North,
  <em>where there are no slaves,</em>
  and upon what grounds do you justify your opposition to, and wholesale abuse
  of, the Colonization Society. If any person is to be enlightened, it is the
  Southern planter. Why not go to the South and disperse your lucubrations—if
  they are so very cogent, wise, and convincing? You are a citizen of the U.
  States, and the Constitution guaranties the freedom of speech and of the
  press. Go to the South, if your zeal is so abundant, your logic so good, and
  be sure that your effusions will be read. If the above extract is the truth,
  (and who shall gainsay it?) how does it condemn the leaders, (for the Unionist
  is too modest to assume that title,) how does it, we say, condemn the conduct
  of the leaders in this “crusade” against the Colonization Society, and the
  Constitution. Such as the Unionist may be too timid to avow their real
  designs—but that the leaders look forward to some modification, and if that
  cannot be obtained, some infraction of the Constitution, few persons opposed
  to them have much doubt. If this extract from the Unionist speaks the language
  of the main body of the abolitionists, they must moderate their tone before
  the public mind can be convinced. If the above is all they aim at, they are
  laboring in a hopeless cause.”

"		There is a paragraph in this excerpt that is actual Unionist content. This is a response to something that <em>The Unionist</em> published in the issue of November 21, 1833 (or, possibly November 14, 1833)
Regarding the Abolition of Slavery in the District of Columbia	<em>Windham Times</em> 	Journalistic Debate; The Unionist; Abolition	"“We see it stated in the “Unionist,” a paper published at Brooklyn, Ct., that a
memorial is in circulation in the eastern part of the State, the object of
which is, ‘the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia.’ Persons
frequently put their names to papers of this description without sufficient
reflection, and on the exparte statement of those who are interested, or have an
object in procuring signatures. Our object in penning this notice is to caution
the public against the movements of the fanatics, and to request every
intelligent man to consider well what he is about before signing this memorial.
It as a scheme fraught with dangerous and alarming consequences—a project that
cannot be executed—and the very attempt to effect it, threatens the tranquility
of the Union. We regard these movements of the northern agitators, in as
infamous a light as those of the southern nullifiers, and they should meet with
universal condemnation. It has been intimated that some of our members of
Congress would countenance this insane project: but we do not believe that the
madness of party desperation will carry any one of them so far. Let no man sign
this memorial who loves his country and would preserve the Union.”
"	Guessing at the date in Windham paper of 1833-11-20, and the issue number of The Unionist here	"The notice about this petition could have appeared in late October or early
November 1833 in the
<em>Unionist.</em>
Resolutions to end slavery in the District of Columbia were passed at the New-England Anti-Slavery
meeting in January 1833, and the American Anti-Slavery organizational meeting in
December 1833. Samuel J May introduced the resolution, which was seconded by Crandall lawyer William Ellsworth in the American Anti-Slavery Society December meeting. So a local campaign in eastern Connecticut, spearheaded by the Unionist, seems logical.

The Norwich <em>Courier</em> Expresses Disdain for <em>The Unionist</em> and Immediate Abolition		Journalistic Debate; The Unionist; Abolition	"<p>
  We cannot consent to be drawn, as the Unionist seems desirous that we should
  be, into a lengthened controversy upon its favorite topic. The whole matter
  lies in a nut-shell, and the editor knows, or ought to know, what is the real
  matter in dispute—when confined to
  <em>that</em>
  there is but little to be said on his side of the subject. It is only by
  multiplying words, and turning off the attention from the true merits of the
  debate, that the abolitionists can hope to obtain a hearing. No better
  evidence is wanted of the weakness of the cause than the confessions of the
  Genius of Temperance, that Abolition cannot hope to succeed without the
  destruction of the Colonization Society. That Society has effected the
  emancipation of many slaves, whereas abolitionism has not yet freed one.
  <em>By their fruits ye shall know them.</em>
  Let us suppose a [..]se—not a very probable one, it must be confessed, yet if
  the abolitionists are to be believed they expect to see a part, at least, of
  it fulfilled—and are laboring to bring it about—Suppose that every person
  north of the Potomac and the Ohio rivers became an abolitionist—as dedicated
  and fierce as Garrison himself—that those who are south of this line remain
  just as they are—some few honorable to the Colonization Society, here and
  there one [..]ling and anxious to be rid of his slaves, but the great majority
  desirous to retain them. Now supposing such a […]e of public opinion—and
  with the Constitution directly in their teeth, what course, we
  ask, would the abolitionists most probably pursue? If they answer,
  <em>we do not know,</em>
  then they are laboring without any definite views—and if they
  <em>do know,</em>
  we should be very glad to be informed. The Unionist has rather inflated (and
  probably mistaken) notions of its own importance. It brags of being admitted
  to the private counsels of the leaders, which we must be permitted to doubt.
  The Unionist is too young to be initiated into all the secrets of the sect.
  Doubtless when Garrison, or his worthy friend from New York, passes along this
  way, they pat the Editor on the head—call him a nice little fellow—let him
  know some of the least important of their plans—tell him to be a good boy,
  and, by the bye, he shall know more—and anon his vanity makes him believe he
  is in their full confidence. As you would avoid disappointment, do not trust
  it too strongly.
</p>
<p>
  The Unionist must excuse us from further notice for the present, and probably
  for some time to come. Congress meet this week, and some very important
  subjects will be brought up for discussion. We wish to listen, and, if
  possible, learn something of their merits.

  MRS. CHILD’ S ‘APPEAL.' Seldom has any work more richly repaid us for the time
  spent in its perusal than Mrs. Child’s ‘Appeal,’ of which an advertisement
  will be found in another column.—Written in a style, easy, simple and elegant;
  enlivened with occasional flashes of wit, rich in important facts, happy
  illustrations and forcible, conclusive reasoning—its satire delicate but keen;
  its appeals touching and powerful; its reproofs grave, just and severe, yet
  couched in language courteous and dignified—it is altogether one of the most
  valuable publications which have for a long time fallen under our eye. We were
  particularly struck with the appearance of extensive research which
  characterizes the work. The gifted authoress lays under contribution; law,
  history and political science, the productions of human genius, and the
  records of divine inspiration, and with admirable skill and taste combines the
  materials drawn from these several sources, into one finished piece of neat
  &amp; polished workmanship. As a powerful auxiliary to the Anti-Slavery cause,
  we feel unable to express our high opinion of its value, and we would only
  express our ardent wish that a copy might be placed in the hands of every
  friend and every enemy of our cause, for the former an armory well stored
  with weapons of approved temper to arm him for combat in the righteous
  cause, to the latter the means of overcoming his opposition, and bringing him

  To us it appears impossible for any candid mind and unprejudiced person to

  a decided Abolitionist. We can confidently recommend the work to all who feel
  interested either way on the subject of slavery, Colonization, and Abolition,
  to all who would wish for a great amount of information&nbsp; on these
  interesting topics, compressed into a small space, and to all who would see an
  important subject handled withfairness , ingenuity and ability, and we

Communications [Speech of William Pinkney]	The Unionist	Abolition; Constitution	"<em>To the Editors of the Unionist:—</em>
  As many persons are so prejudiced against color as to pronounce a black
  complexion an evidence of Divine displeasure, you are requested to insert in
  the “Unionist” the following extracts from a speech delivered in the
  house of Delegates of Maryland at their session in November, 1789, by that
  upright and enlightened statesman, William Pinkney, Esq. Let his sentiments be
  contrasted with those to whom I have alluded. If as Archbishop Seeker has
  asserted that “every death in battle is a murder,” the writer of this
  introductory article verily believes that for the death of a Slave occasioned
  by his servile condition the owner is responsible, and our country has
  abundant and fearful reason to deprecate the solemn and awful denunciation
  expressed in thsi (sic) sacred interrogatory—“Shall I not visit for these
  things, saith the Lord? Shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as
  this?” – HUMANITAS”
</p>
<p>
  “Mr. Speaker, Iniquitous and most dishonorable to Maryland is that dreary
  system of partial bondage, which her laws have hitherto supported with a
  solicitude worthy of a better object, and Citizens by their practice
  countenanced. Founded in a disgraceful traffic, to which the parent country
  lent her fostering aid, from motives of interest, but which even she would
  have disdained to encourage, had England been the destined mart of such
  inhuman merchandize; its continuance is as shameful as its origin.
</p>
<p>
  Eternal infamy await the abandoned miscreants whose selfish souls could ever
  prompt them to rob unhappy Afric of her souls, and freight them hither by
  thousands, to poison the fair Eden of liberty with the rank weed of individual
  bondage. Nor is it more to the credit of our ancestors that they did not
  command these savage spoilers to bear their hateful cargo to another shore,
  where the shrine of freedom knew no votaries, and every purchaser would at
  once be both a master and a slave.
</p>
<p>
  In the dawn of time, Mr. Speaker, when the rough feelings of barbarism had not
  experienced the softening touches of refinement, such an unprincipled
  prostration of the inherent rights of human nature, would have needed the
  gloss of an apology: but to the everlasting reproach of Maryland, be it said,
  that when her citizens rivalled the nation from whence they emigrated, in the
  knowledge of moral principles, and an enthusiasm in the cause of general
  freedom, they stooped to become the purchasers of their fellow creatures, and
  to introduce an hereditary bondage into the bosom of their country, which
  should widen with every successive generation.
</p>
<p>
  For my part, I would willingly draw the veil of oblivion over this disgusting
  scene of iniquity, but that the present abject state of those who are
  descended from these kidnapped sufferers, perpetually brings it forward to the
  memory.
</p>
<p>
  But wherefore should we confine the edge of censure to our ancestors, or those
  from whom they purchased? Are not we equally guilty?
  <em>They</em>
  strewed around the seeds of slavery;
  <em>we</em>
  cherish and sustain the growth.—
  <em>They</em>
  introduced the system;
  <em>we</em>
  enlarge, invigorate, and conform it.—Yes, let it be handed down to posterity,
  that the people of Maryland, who could fly to arms with the promptitude of
  Roman citizens, when the hand of oppression was lifted up against
  themselves—who could behold their country desolated, and their citizens
  slaughtered, who could brave with unshaken firmness, every calamity of war,
  before they would submit to the smallest infringement of their rights—that
  this very people could yet see thousands of their fellow creatures, within the
  limits of their territory, bending beneath an unnatural yoke; and instead of
  being assiduous to destroy their shackles, anxious to immortalize their
  duration, so that a nation of slaves might for ever exist in a country where
  freedom is its boast.
</p>
<p>
  “Even the very earth itself, (says some celebrated author) which teems with
  profusion under the cultivating hand of the freeborn laborer, shrinks into
  barrenness from the contaminating sweat of a slave.” This sentiment is not
  more figuratively beautiful than substantially just.
</p>
<p>
  Survey the countries, sir, where the hand of freedom conducts the ploughshare
  and compare their produce with yours.—Your granaries in this view appear like
  the store houses of emmets [a colloquial word for “ant”], though not supplied
  with equal industry. To trace the cause of this disparity between the fruits
  of a freeman’s voluntary labors, animated by the hope of profit, and the
  slow-paced efforts of a slave, who acts only from compulsion, who has no
  incitement to exertion but fear—no prospect of remuneration to encourage—would
  be insulting the understanding. The cause and the effect are too obvious to
  escape observation.
</p>
<p>
  But it has been said (and who knows but the same opinion may still have its
  advocates) “that nature has black balled these wretches out of society.”
  Gracious God! can it be supposed that thy Almighty Providence intended to
  proscribe these victims of fraud and power, from the pale of society, because
  thou hast denied them the delicacy of an European complexion? Is their color,
  Mr. Speaker, the mark of Divine vengeance, or is it only the flimsy pretext
  upon which we attempt to justify our treatment of them? Arrogant and
  presumptuous is it this to make the dispensations of Providence subservient to
  the purposes of iniquity, and every slight diversity in the works of nature
  the apology for oppression. Thus acts the intemperate bigot in religion. He
  persecutes every dissenter from his creed, in the name of God, and even rears
  the horrid fabric of an inquisition upon heavenly foundations.
</p>
<p>
  I like not these holy arguments. They are as convenient for the tyrant as the
  patriot—the enemy as the friend of mankind. Contemplate this subject through
  the calm medium of philosophy, and then to know that these shackled wretches
  are men as well as we are, spring from the same common parent, and endued with
  equal faculties of mind and body, is to know enough to make us disdain to torn
  casuists on their complexion to the destruction of their rights. The beauty of
  complexion is mere matter of taste, and varies indifferent countries, nay,
  even in the same; and shall we dare to set up this vague, indeterminate,
  weathercock standard, as the criterion by which shall be decided on what
  complexions the rights of human nature are conferred, and to what they are
  denied by the great ordinances of the Deity? As if the Ruler of the Universe
  had made the darkness of a skin, the flatness of a nose, or the wideness of a
  mouth, which are only deformities or beauties as the undulating tribunal of
  taste shall determine the indication of his wrath.
</p>
<p>
  Mr. Speaker, It is pitiable to reflect on the mistaken light in which this
  unfortunate generation are viewed by the people in general. Hardly do they
  deign to rank them in the order of beings above the mere animal that grazes
  the field of its owner. That an humble, dusky, unlettered wretch that drags
  the chain of bondage through the weary round of life, with no other privilege
  but that of existing for another’s benefit should have been intended by heaven
  for their equal they will not believe. But let me appeal to the intelligent
  mind, and ask, in what respect they are our inferiors? Though they have never
  been taught to tread the paths of science, or embellish human life by literary
  acquirements; tho’ they cannot soar into the regions of taste and sentiment,
  or explore the scenes of philosophical research, is it to be inferred that
  they want the power, if the yoke of slavery did not check each aspiring effort
  and clog the springs of action? Let the kind hand of an assiduous care mature
  their powers, let the genius of freedom excite to manly thought and liberal
  investigation, we should not then be found to monopolize the vigor of fancy,
  the delicacy of taste, or the solidity of scientific endowments. Born with
  hearts as susceptible of virtuous impressions as our own, and with minds as
  capable of benefitting by improvement, they are in all respects our equals by
  nature; and he who thinks otherwise has never reflected, that talents however
  great may perish unnoticed and unknown, unless auspicious circumstances
  conspire to draw them forth, and animate their exertions in the round of
  knowledge. As well might you expect to see the bubbling fountain gush from the
  burning sands of Arabia, as that the inspiration of genius or the enthusiastic
  glow of sentiment should rouse the mind which has yielded its elasticity to
  habitual subjection. Thus the ignorance and the vices of these wretches are
  solely the result of situation, and therefore no evidence of their
  inferiority. Like the flower whose culture has been neglected, and perishes
  amidst permitted weeds ere it opens it blossom to the Spring, they only prove
  the imbecility of human nature unassisted and oppressed. Well has Cowper said—
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘’Tis
  liberty alone which gives the flower
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of fleeting
  life its lustre and perfume,
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And we are
  weeds without it.’

He also performed ably as a diplomat and Attorney General. His reputation as an orator was strong. Pinkney's speech here, from early in his career, was in circulation among the Abolitionists; his fame and his writings were amplified in the 1820s at the time of his death.	William Pinkney

Letter to the Editor regarding the <em>Norwich Courier</em>	The Unionist	Abolition; Canterbury Female Academy; Prudence Crandall; Journalistic Debate; Constitution	"<p>
  The following communication from a christian, a philanthropist, and a
  gentleman, we insert with pleasure. The language is energetic, occasionally
  severe, but we hold not ourself answerable for its severity. The circumstances
  of the case justify it. Cruel charges, unsubstantiated by the least shadow of
  evidence, have been too frequently brought against Abolitionists, and we have
  a right to demand the proof or a retraction, and if neither is given, he who
  makes those charge is, to say the least, a traducer of character.
</p>
<p><em>For the Unionist.</em></p>
<p>To the Editor of the Norwich Courier</p>
<p>
  SIR—I presume that you will agree with me in the sentiment that the editor of
  a public journal is under weighty responsibilities, and should suffer nothing
  to appear in the columns of his publication but with extreme caution. Opinions
  disseminated through the columns of a newspaper will, to a greater or less
  degree, influence the opinions of the reading community, and when the editor
  of a paper advocates any particular doctrine, he doubtless desires that his
  readers may adhere to the same doctrine. Great care therefore is necessary
  that a person in your connexion with community should disseminate thro’ that
  community, precepts which shall bear the test of truth—principles founded upon
  the strictest rules of justice and sound morality. You sir, I presume,
  professing to be governed by high and honorable motives, will readily assent
  to this, and at all times be willing to turn your attention to any thing which
  may have escaped your pen, and if any one of your readers should be so
  unfortunate as to differ from you in sentiment, you will, I presume,
  cheerfully examine the ground of their complaints, to be convinced, or to show
  some reason for a different course.
</p>
<p>
  I would request of you, sir, to re-peruse an article which appeared under your
  editorial head, Oct. 23d, in relation to Miss Crandall’s school and the
  sentiments of the abolitionists. I would ask you to do it calmly and
  dispassionately—
  <em>searching for the truth</em>
  —unbiased by opinions previously expressed, farther than you find
  <em>reason</em>
  to be your supporter.
</p>
<p>
  You say, “Although we think that Miss Crandall has a right to continue her
  school we are by no means friendly to the doctrines which are said to be
  taught in it; yet these doctrines can never be put down by persecution—they
  must be met by fair argument, and in such a contest they will prove wholly
  untenable.” I am glad to find that you have never denied the
  <em>right</em>
  of Miss Crandall to teach such a school—it is rather a matter or surprise to
  me, as it probably is to you, that New-England should contain an enlightened
  man who
  <em>would</em>
  deny that right. I know not what doctrines you have heard to be taught in that
  school, neither have you seen fit to inform the public. But you have said that
  <em>dangerous</em>
  doctrines are taught there that ought to be “put down.” If so, are not you,
  sir, bound to tell us what these doctrines are, as you wish to enlighten the
  public all you can—to overthrow these dangerous doctrines, and to free society
  from their contamination, will you not condescend to meet them by “fair
  argument,” as “in such a contest” you are confident “they will prove wholly
  untenable?” I am anxious to see, what I have never yet seen and feat I never
  shal, the attempt made to “put them down” by “fair argument,” instead of
  addled eggs, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
  You say again, “The least that can be said of the Abolition scheme is that it
  is an
  <em>insane</em>
  project—one which no man in the full possession and exercise of his faculties
  can contemplate as being practicable, or at the present time desirable.” I
  know, sir, it is very easy for a person, especially when under a little
  excitement, to go on and make severe accusations against his opponents, but it
  is quite another thing to show the reason of these accusations. I might say
  that the editor of the Norwich Courier was governed by passion and prejudice,
  with as much ease as you charge Abolitionists of insanity; and I doubt not,
  sir, that I should be able to substantiate my charge as soon as you yours. I
  have seen similar charges in your paper before, but I have never known of your
  being more particular. You are satisfied with making a general assertion, why
  not specify wherein this insanity consists? The leading doctrine of the
  Abolitionists is that no man has a right to hold his fellow man in bondage a
  single moment. Is this insane? Is it untrue? Is it a fact that man
  <em>has a right</em>
  to rob his fellow man of liberty—of
  <em>himself?</em>
  If he
  <em>has</em>
  such a right, tell me, sir, who gave him that right, and how long it is to
  continue. If he has a
  <em>right</em>
  to hold him in bondage
  <em>one</em>
  moment, how many moments may he have that right? But who are these insane
  Abolitionists? How long since this spirit of insanity come upon them? They are
  all around you—men of distinguished worth—of brilliant talents—to whom you,
  sire, in your highest estimation of yourself, never considered yourself worthy
  to be called an equal. You accuse them of forwarding a project which is not
  desirable. Do you pronounce them all hypocrites? No, you dare not, but they
  are
  <em>insane,</em>
  and therefore may be, for aught you know, sincere. But they are men of
  exemplary piety—men of fervent prayer—of extensive influence in promoting the
  cause of our Redeemer. You have not been accustomed to pronounce them
  insane—even now you are ready to quote their opinions upon other subjects and
  would place more confidence in their judgment than in your own. How happens it
  that their insanity is confined to this subject alone?
</p>
<p>
  You say, “The agitators appear to have bid adieu to common sense and a regard
  for the constitution and the laws,” &amp;c. I know not what you call bidding
  adieu to common sense, but one thing I know, that the leading Abolitionists in
  our country are the leading men in every other project to benefit the human
  race—men distinguished for their moral courage, seeking for the approval of
  God rather than for the favor of man. They have inquired for the path of duty
  and having ascertained it they have not failed to run in that path. Some,
  perhaps, might say that common sense in this respect is a disposition to act
  in a manner most congenial with popular feeling, If this is your definition of
  the term, I admit that they have ‘bid adieu to common sense,’ but as I
  understand the term they have most strictly adhered to it.
</p>
<p>
  As for the charge of their disregarding the constitution and the laws, I think
  it a very grave accusation to be brought against many of the best men of our
  country. But you, sir, are not the only one who has seen fit to make
  it—neither are you the only one who has made it without specifying what part
  of the constitution or what laws they disregard—and I must tell you, sire,
  that neither you nor all the wholesale accusers who you join
  <em>can</em>
  point out a single line of our constitution from which Abolitionists, as such,
  have departed. “Bid adieu to a regard for the constitution!” It is not
  true—and I here call upon you, sir, to clear your character from the
  imputation of falsehood. I would not say, sir, that you
  <em>intended</em>
  to assert an untruth, but I
  <em>do</em>
  say that you
  <em>have</em>
  asserted one, and unless you retract or substantiate it, the charge of
  falsehood must rest upon you. Is it unconstitutional to assert that it is
  morally wrong to hold slaves? Does the constitution of a free, republican
  people forbid that we should
  <em>speak against</em>
  chaining the mortal body and degrading the immortal mind? Is it against the
  constitution of a Christian people to declaim against the cruel system of
  slavery? —to say that it is contrary to the righteous laws of God—that it is
  inconsistent with the spirit of the gospel and the precepts of our Savior? Is
  it a fact that the
  <em>republicans</em>
  of the United States hold one sixth of their number in the chains of the
  veriest despotism—that
  <em>two millions</em>
  of our fellow creatures are groaning under worse than Egyptian servitude—that
  <em>two million</em>
  of immortal souls are shut out from the light of science and closed to the
  entrance of one cheering ray from the Sun of Righteousness—and that when a few
  fearless men stand forth and say that these things are
  <em>wrong,</em>
  you, the editor of a public journal, cry out that in so saying they have “bid
  adieu to a regard for the constitution?” Tell me, sir, if these things are
  facts? O that you could tell me that they were not facts! But, alas! they are.
  We must not say that it is
  <em>wrong</em>
  to degrade the image of God to a level with the brutes that perish, for it is
  unconstitutional. Thank God!&nbsp; we have no such constitution as this! Shame
  on my countrymen! Shame on any republican asserting such a doctrine! I know
  the constitution
  <em>permits</em>
  the several states to hold slaves if they choose—but no where does it say that
  we
  <em>shall not</em>
  raise our voices against this abominable system. Wherein, then, have
  Abolitionists “bid adieu to a regard for the constitution?” Will you, sir,
  point out this treason, or cease longer to make an unfounded accusation?
</p>
<p>
  You say, “That this unprincipled opposition to the labors of the Colonization
  Society will raise up many warm friends to the latter there is abundant ground
  to hope.” As “unprincipled,: sir, as these ‘agitators’ may be, I deem it no
  disparagement to you to say that they are men in the splendor of whose moral
  qualities you would be hardly visible, and whose names will be breathed with
  veneration by the virtuous and the good when yours shall have long been
  forgotten. But I am perfectly willing that you should, if you can, console
  yourself that by this opposition many warm friends will be raised up to the
  Colonization Society, but perhaps it may soften future disappointment, to
  inform you that many of those who have been :warm friends” to that society are
  flocking around the Abolition standard, and however many ‘warm friends’ the
  Colonization Society may have, the cause of Abolition must forever stand. AS
  long as justice reigns in heaven and sin is found on earth, so long will those
  be found who will exert themselves to hasten the triumph of the former and
  crush and extirpate the latter, and as sure as God is good so sure will he
  cause them to prosper.
</p>
<p>
  Again you say, “If the blacks are to be benefitted at all, it can only be
  accomplished by the aid of the Colonization Society, and their removal to
  Africa.” O that you had spared the penning of that sentence! What principle do
  you mean to advocate? Into what would you convert our happy land? What, sir,
  shall we think of the man, professing to be governed by that religion which
  commands us to love our neighbor as ourselves, who tells us that here are two
  and a half millions of immortal beings among us, degraded and wretched, and if
  they “are to be benefitted at all” it must be by “their removal to Africa?”
  What, in the name of God, is the reason they cannot be benefitted here? What
  but that you and some of your brother editors are so wickedly prejudiced
  against them that you are determined they
  <em>shall not be?</em>
  They
  <em>can</em>
  be benefitted here—they
  <em>will</em>
  be benefitted here. The number of blacks in this country will never be less
  than at the present moment—for in the first place we have not the means to
  make them less, increasing as they do 70,000 per year, and in the second place
  if we had the means of carrying them to Africa they do not want to go. They
  must always remain with us unless we serve them as we have served the poor
  Indians, and though you may continue to assert that they must always remain
  degraded, yet ever true Christian will rejoice that God in his good providence
  has ordered it otherwise.

Declaration of the National Anti-Slavery Society	The Unionist	Abolition; National News	"<p>DECLARATION OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY CONVENTION.</p>
<p>
  The Convention, assembled in the City of Philadelphia to organize a National
  Anti-Slavery Society, promptly seize the opportunity to promulgate the
  following DECLARATION OF SENTIMENTS, as cherished by them in relation to the
  enslavement of one-sixth portion of the American people.
</p>
<p>
  More than fifty-seven years have elapsed since a band of patriots convened in
  this place, to devise measures for the deliverance of this country from a
  foreign yoke. The corner-stone upon which they founded the TEMPLE OF FREEDOM
  was broadly this—“that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by
  their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life,
  LIBERTY, and the pursuit of happiness.” At the sound of their trumpet-call,
  three millions of people rose up as from the sleep of death, and rushed to the
  strife of blood; deeming it more glorious to die instantly as freemen, than
  desirable to live one hour as slaves.—They were few in number—poor in
  resources; but the honest conviction that Truth and Justice, were on their
  side, made them invincible.
</p>
<p>
  We have met together for the achievement of an enterprise, without which, that
  of our fathers is incomplete, and which, for its magnitude, solemnity, and
  probable results upon the destiny of the world, as far transcends theirs, as
  moral truth does physical force.
</p>
<p>
  In purity of motive, in earnestness of zeal, in decision of purpose, in
  intrepidity of action, in stead fastness of faith, in sincerity of spirit, we
  would not be inferior to them.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Their</em>
  principles led them to wage war against their oppressors, and to spill human
  blood like water, in order to be free.
  <em>Ours</em>
  forbid the doing of evil that good may come, and lead us to reject, the use of
  all carnal weapons for deliverance from bondage—relying solely upon those
  which are spiritual, and mighty through God to the pulling down of strong
  holds.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Their</em>
  measures were physical resistance—the marshalling in arms—the hostile
  array—the mortal encounter.
  <em>Ours</em>
  shall be such only as the opposition of moral purity to moral corruption—the
  destruction of error by the potency of truth—the overthrow of prejudice by the
  power of love—and the abolition of slavery by the spirit of repentance.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Their</em>
  grievances, great as they were, were trifling in comparison with the wrongs
  and sufferings of those for whom we plead. Our fathers were never slaves—never
  bought and sold like cattle—never shut out from the light of knowledge and
  religion—never subjected to the lash of brutal taskmasters.
</p>
<p>
  But those, for whose emancipation we are striving, —constituting at the
  present time at least one-sixth part of our countrymen, are recognized by the
  laws, and treated by their fellow beings, as marketable commodities—as goods
  and chattels—as brute beasts—are plundered daily of the fruits of their toil
  without redress;—really enjoy no constitutional nor legal protection from
  licentious and murderous outrages upon their persons;—are ruthlessly torn
  asunder—the tender babe from the arms of its frantic mother—the heart-broken
  wife from her weeping husband—at the caprice or pleasure of irresponsible
  tyrants;—and, for the crime of having a dark complexion, suffer the pangs of
  hunger, the infliction of stripes, and the ignominy of brutal servitude. They
  are kept in heathenish darkness by laws expressly enacted to make their
  instruction a criminal offence.
</p>
<p>
  These are the prominent circumstances in the condition of more than TWO
  MILLIONS of our people, proof of which may be found in thousands of
  indisputable facts, and in the laws of the slaveholding States.
</p>
<p>Hence we maintain—</p>
<p>
  That in view of the civil and religious privileges of this nation, the guilt
  of its oppression is unequalled by any other on the face of the earth;—and,
  therefore,
</p>
<p>
  That it is bound to repent instantly, to undo the heavy burden, to break every
  yoke, and let the oppressed go free.
</p>
<p>We farther maintain—</p>
<p>
  That no man has a right to enslave or imbrute his brother—to hold or
  acknowledge him, for one moment, as a piece of merchandise—to keep back his
  hire by fraud—or to brutalize his mind by denying him the means of
  intellectual, social and moral improvement.
</p>
<p>
  The right to enjoy liberty is inalienable. To invade it, is to usurp the
  prerogative of Jehovah. Every man has a right to his own body—to the products
  of his own labor—to the protection of law—and to the common advantages of
  society. It is piracy to buy or steal a native African and subject him to
  servitude. Surely the sin is as great to enslave an American as an African.
</p>
<p>Therefore we believe and affirm—</p>
<p>
  That there is no difference,
  <em>in principle,</em>
  between the African slave trade and American slavery;
</p>
<p>
  That every American citizen, who retains a human being in involuntary bondage,
  is [according to Scripture] a MAN-STEALER;
</p>
<p>
  That the slaves ought instantly to be set free, and brought under the
  protection of law;
</p>
<p>
  That if they had lived from the time of Pharaoh down to the present period,
  and had been entailed through successive generations, their right to be free
  could never have been alienated, but their claims would have constantly risen
  in solemnity;
</p>
<p>
  That all those laws which are not in force, admitting the right of slavery,
  are therefore before God utterly null and void, being an audacious usurpation
  of the Divine prerogative, a daring infringement on the law of nature, a base
  overthrow of the very foundations of the social compact, a complete extinction
  of all the relations, endearments and obligations of mankind, and a
  presumptuous transgression of all the holy commandments—and that therefore
  they ought to be instantly abrogated.
</p>
<p>We further believe and affirm—</p>
<p>
  That all persons of color who possess the qualifications which are demanded of
  others, ought to be admitted forthwith to the enjoyment of the same
  privileges, and the exercise of the same prerogatives, as others; and that the
  paths of preferment, of wealth. and of intelligence, shall be opened as widely
  to them as to persons of a white complexion.
</p>
<p>
  We maintain that no compensation should be given to the planters emancipating
  their slaves—
</p>
<p>
  Because it would be a surrender of the great fundamental principle that man
  cannot hold property in man;
</p>
<p>
  Because
  <em>Slavery is a crime, and therefore is not an article to be sold;</em>
</p>
<p>
  Because the holders of slaves are not the just proprietors of what they claim;
  freeing the slaves is not depriving them of property, but restoring it to the
  right owner; —it is not wronging the master, but righting the slave—restoring
  him to himself;
</p>
<p>
  Because immediate and general emancipation would only destroy nominal, not
  real property it would not amputate a limb or break a bone of the slaves, but
  by infusing motives into their breasts, would make them doubly valuable to the
  masters as free laborers; and
</p>
<p>
  Because if compensation is to be given at all, it should be given to the
  outraged and guiltless slaves, and not to those who have plundered and abused
  them.
</p>
<p>
  We regard, as delusive, cruel and dangerous, any scheme of expatriation which
  pretends to aid, either directly or indirectly, in the emancipation of the
  slaves, or to be a substitute for the immediate and total abolition of
  slavery.
</p>
<p>
  We fully and unanimously recognize the sovereignty of each State, to legislate
  exclusively on the subject of the slavery which is tolerated within its
  limits. We concede that Congress, under the present national compact, has no
  right to interfere with any of the slave states, in relation to this momentous
  subject.
</p>
<p>
  But we maintain that Congress has a right, and is solemnly bound, to suppress
  the domestic slave trade between the several States, and to abolish slavery in
  those portions of our territory which the Constitution has placed under its
  exclusive jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>
  We also maintain that there are, at the present time, the highest obligations
  resting upon the people of the free States, to remove slavery by moral and
  political action, as prescribed in the Constitution of United States. They are
  now living under a pledge of their tremendous physical force to fasten the
  galling fetters of tyranny upon the limbs of millions in the southern
  States;—they are liable to be called at any moment to suppress a general
  insurrection of the slaves;—they authorize the slave owner to vote for
  three-fifths of his slaves as property, and thus enable him to perpetuate his
  oppression;—they support a standing army at the south for its protection;—and
  they seize the slave who has escaped into their territories, and send him back
  to be tortured by an enraged master or a brutal driver.
</p>
<p>
  This relation to slavery is criminal and full of danger:
  <em>it must be broken up.</em>
</p>
<p>
  These are our views and principles—these, our designs and measures. With
  entire confidence in the overruling justice of God, we plant ourselves upon
  the Declaration of our Independence, and upon the truth of Divine Revelation,
  as upon the Everlasting Rock.
</p>
<p>
  We shall organize Anti-Slavery Societies, if possible, in every city, town and
  village of our land.
</p>
<p>
  We shall send forth Agents to lift up the voice of remonstrance, of warning of
  entreaty and rebuke.
</p>
<p>
  We shall circulate, unsparingly and extensively, anti slavery tracts and
  periodicals.
</p>
<p>
  We shall enlist the Pulpit and the Press in the cause of the suffering and the
  dumb.
</p>
<p>
  We shall aim at a purification of the churches from all participation in the
  guilt of slavery.
</p>
<p>
  We shall encourage the labor of freemen over that of the slaves, by giving a
  preference to their productions;—and
</p>
<p>
  We shall spare no exertions nor means to bring the whole nation to speedy
  repentance.
</p>
<p>
  Our trust for victory is solely in GOD.
  <em>We</em>
  may be personally defeated, but our principles never. TRUTH, JUSTICE, and
  HUMANITY, must and will gloriously triumph. Already a host is coming up to the
  help of the Lord against the mighty, and the prospect before us is full of
  encouragement.
</p>
<p>
  Submitting this DECLARATION to the candid examination of the people of this
  country, and of the friends of liberty all over the world, we hereby affix our
  signatures to it; pledging ourselves that, under the guidance and by the help
  of Almighty God, we will do all that in us lies, consistently with this
  Declaration of our principles, to overthrow the most execrable system of
  slavery that has ever been witnessed upon earth—to deliver our land from its
  deadliest curse—to wipe out the foulest stain which rests upon our national
  escutcheon—and to secure to the colored population of the United States all
  the rights and privileges which belong to them as men and as Americans—come
  what may to our persons, our interests, or our reputations—whether we live to
  witness the triumph of Justice, Liberty and Humanity, or perish untimely as
  martyrs in this great, benevolent, and holy cause.

"		"There is much to add, relevant to <em>The Unionist</em> and the Canterbury Female Academy, to this Declaration. <p>
  In the same issue of <em>The Abolitionist</em> that printed the Declaration, African-American delegate Robert Purvis delivered an encomium for William Lloyd Garrison:
  <em>The Abolitionist</em>
  1:12:183 (December 1833)
</p><p>In a pair of motions intimately related to the Canterbury Female Academy, the convention expressed its appreciation of education in general, and Canterbury in particular.</p>
<p>""On motion of Simeon S. Jocelyn, seconded by Amos A. Phelps, it was</p>
<p>
  Resolved.&nbsp; That the fountains of knowledge, like those of salvation,
  should be open to every creature, and that we regard those laws and prejudices
  which prevent or restrict the education of the people of color, bond or free,
  as pre-eminently cruel and impious, and disgraceful to a christian state or
  nation; and that we will seek their abolishment, both in the free and slave
  States, if possible more earnestly than corporeal slavery itself, in as much
  as ignorance enslaves the mind, and tends to the ruin of the immortal soul.
</p>
<p>On motion of John Prentice, seconded by William Goodell, it was</p>
<p>
  Resolved, That this convention highly approve of the philanthropic effort of
  Miss Prudence Crandall of Canterbury, Conn. in her labors to instruct our
  colored sisters; and while we deeply sympathize with her in view of the
  persecutions she has endured in the prosecution of her pious purposes, we
  pledge ourselves to afford her our continued countenance and assistance""
  <em>The Abolitionist</em>
  1:12:184 (December 1833) Goodell was the editor of <em>The Genius of Temperance</em>; Jocelyn and Phelps were both endorsers of the Canterbury Female Academy.
</p>
<p>
  <em>The Abolitionist</em> in that same December issue also published a letter from Charles Stuart to William Lloyd Garrison, that
  made reference also to letters from Buffum and
  Forten: ""Many hearts are beating here for the glorious Prudence
  Crandall. Some of my young friends are working little parcels of
  presents for me to take to her dear pupils in the Spring."" (written from
  Liverpool)

<p>
  Samuel Joseph May and John G. Whittier worked with the principal author, William Lloyd Garrison, on the 1833 Declaration of Sentiments of the American Anti-Slavery Society. The language of the Declaration, and the sense of who was behind it, demonstrates how nonviolence already held some prominence in the movement at the time of the Canterbury Female Academy. Furthermore, they were working at the home of African-American activist and dentist James McCrummell (Benjamin Quarles, <em>Black Abolitionists</em> New York: Da Capo Press, 1991; original edition 1969, p. vii-viii)

Is It Safe to Obey God?	The Unionist	Abolition; Religion	"<p>THE UNIONIST</p>
<p>BROOKLYN, DECEMBER 19, 1833.</p>
<p>
  <em>Is it safe to obey God?—</em>
  Startle not at the query, reader, but answer it candidly. Has God commanded us
  to do any thing which would be unsafe and
  inexpedient for us to do? If he has, then, painful as it might seem, it is our
  duty to obey, for surely God will not require an unnecessary sacrifice of any
  one. But we believe that it is not only always
  <em>safe</em>
  to obey the commands of God, but that our safety consists in such obedience
  alone. We believe that He commands us to do nothing except what is for our
  best good, and that we are not safe for a moment while we refuse to obey.
  Should we not therefore obey
  <em>all</em>
  the commands of God—
  <em>now ‑ immediately?</em>
  We should—the candid and christian reader will echo the reply,
  <em>“we should!”</em>
  Well—so much for the sermon, now for the application.
</p>
<p>
  God has commanded—
  <em>“Undo the heavy burdens and let the oppressed go free.”</em>
  Not yet, says the colonizationist—the oppressed, though they are happy and
  contended in their bondage, would so highly resent the gift of liberty and the
  proffer of kindness and sympathy that they would cut our throats for the gift
  and burn our dwellings for the proffer. It would not be safe to obey the
  command of God NOW—wait, and let us leave off sinning by degrees and make a
  compromise with God that will leave us in our sins a few years longer. Such
  is, in effect, the reasoning of the apologist for slavery. When will the time
  come in which men will think it sage and expedient to obey the Supreme Ruler
  of the Universe?
</p>
"	"I corrected an obvious printer's error in the line ""Has God commanded us
  to do any thing which would be unsafe and
  inexpedient for us to do?"" - where the word ""and"" was rendered as ""are."""	Biblical reference is to Isaiah 58:6
A Few Questions	The Unionist	Abolition; Religion	"<p>
  A FEW QUESTIONS—We do not wish to be impertinent, nor meddle with that which
  is none of our business—but we wish to ask a few questions, and we do it with
  a sincere desire to do good, whether we shall, to any extent, effect our
  object we leave for time to determine.
</p>
<p>“Is the holding of our fellow men in bondage a sin?”</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;“Is it our duty ever to repent of sin, and if so, when? now or at some
  indefinite future?
</p>
<p>
  Do any clergymen who preach to their hearers the duty of&nbsp; immediate
  repentence oppose immediate emancipation, the immediate restoration of right
  to the slave who has long been robbed of his earnings and treated as a brute?
  and if so where is his consistency?
</p>
<p>
  Has God pronounced a judgment upon him who withholds from the laborer his
  hire? If so is the slaveholder obnoxious to this judgment?
</p>
<p>Can that man who is a habitual robber be a christian?</p>
<p>
  Is not the slaveholder who refuses to emancipate his slaves a robber of man
  and of God? Reader, ponder these questions well—and answer them to your
  conscience and your God.
</p>
"		With William Burleigh on board as a co-editor, I am not yet in a position to be able to distinguish between the two brothers on the basis of style. However, I would hazard a guess that this is William Burleigh, due to its more religiously-inflected tone.
The cause of Temperance	The Unionist	Allied Reform Movements - Temperance	"The cause of Temperance prospers well in Massachusetts. Our good friends there
are doing nobly—they have their heart in the work. MR. FROST, the Apostle of
Temperance, and an eloquent and able man, has been lecturing in Norfolk County,
and his labors have been attended with the most gratifying success. Those of our
friends who have had the pleasure of hearing Mr. F. will not be surprised at
this. He possesses to an eminent degree the power of awakening and enchaining
the attention. His oratory is peculiar to himself—at least we never heard of its
model or successful imitation—always elevated and always fascinating. His voice
is musical—his gesticulation forcible, and, more than all, his acquaintance with
his subject in all its bearing is perfect, and his facility in rightly arranging
and applying sarcasm and argument, ridicule and persuasion, truly wonderful. By
Mr. Frost’s report it appears that when he commenced his agency in the County,
there were twenty-eight Temperance Societies, embracing 6,511 members, to which
have been added 2,375 others, and fourteen new societies have been organized,
embracing 761 members. This tells well for Temperance effort in Massachusetts.
Let our Connecticut friends do likewise.
"		I have not yet determined if the hyper-active Temperance Advocate Daniel Frost is the same as the Daniel Frost, Jr., of Canterbury (1787-1863), who was among the opponents of the Canterbury Female Academy.	Daniel Frost
Seeing Angels	The Unionist	African-American Students; Education	"Two men in Chatham, Ct. lately saw, according to their own account, an angel! To
one of them the celestial visitant appeared three different times, revealing to
him a future famine and an earthquake. Now we see no propriety in trying to make
it appear as something very strange to see an angel. Such sights are by no means
rare in Brooklyn. We see some half dozen every day—and by happy smiles that so
beautifully curl their pouting ruby lips we should suppose they were thinking of
things more agreeable than famine and earthquake. Ours are intellectual angels
withal, for we usually see them with a book under one arm—and—and—but we are a
confirmed bachelor and dare not venture another word upon the subject.
"		Because William Burleigh was teaching at the Canterbury Female Academy, it is likely he wrote this commentary about his angelic students. This was as defiant of racial norms as was the naming of the school for "Young Ladies and Little Misses of Color." Similar to that move, it may sound discordant to our twenty-first century ears, as if this was a salacious comment, but I doubt it was intended that way.
National Anti-Slavery Convention was not held behind closed doors	The Unionist	Abolition	"<p>
  We have heard complaints made relative to the National Anti-Slavery Convention
  that their sitting was with closed doors.&nbsp; This assertion has been
  repeatedly made in our presence, with apparent exultation in the belief that
  the statement would injure the cause—and though we do not love to goad the
  already desperate, truth compels us to assert, that the charge is utterly
  false. The convention did NOT sit, during any portion of their session, with
  closed doors. We make this assertion fearlessly—for our informant is one whose
  veracity is unquestionable—JOHN G. WHITTIER, who was himself Secretary of the
  convention.
</p>
<p>
  We have no doubt but the formation of the National Society will madden the
  foes of liberty, and drive them to the more frequent use of their old weapons,
  vituperation and falsehood, but the cause of truth and justice is onward,
  onward, and its progress cannot be staid. Check the flow of the ocean-tide,
  fetter the leaping lightning, hold back the sun from his course of strength,
  but seek not to impede the march of Emancipation.

"		G. Tillotson was Rev. George Jeffrey Tillotson (1805-1888), Congregational minister of Brooklyn Connecticut. He was the minister who agreed to officiate the marriage of Prudence Crandall and Calvin Philleo, when the Congregational minister of Canterbury declined on the day of the wedding. He had begun his ministerial career in Brooklyn with the Execution Sermon for Oliver Watkins, the murderer whose cell in the Brooklyn Jail later housed Prudence Crandall. For the text of that sermon, see <em>Windham County Advertiser</em>, 5:52 (August 2, 1831), p. 3. Tillotson had a personal friendship with Abolitionist and Crandall endorser Amos A. Phelps; see this <a href="https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/search?f%5Bname_facet_ssim%5D%5B%5D=Tillotson%2C+George+Jeffrey%2C+1805-1888">digitized collection of letters.</a> After the Civil War, he donated substantially to an institution of higher learning for Freedmen in Austin, Texas, which was named the <a href="https://www.pvamu.edu/tiphc/wp-content/uploads/sites/107/GeorgeTillotson.pdf">Tillotson Institute</a> in his honor. The school still exists today, as Huston-Tillotson University , an HBCU in Austin.

  to have been read by him to the Heads of the Several Departments, relating to
  the deposites [sic] of the public money in the Treasury of the United States,
  and alledged [sic] to have been published by his authority, be genuine that he

</p>
<p align=""center"">HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</p>
<p align=""right"">TUESDAY, December 10.</p>
<p>
  On motion of Mr McDuffie, the Report of the Secretary on the removal of the
  deposites [sic], was taken up and referred to the Committee of the Whole on
  the state of the Union.
</p>
<p>
  Mr Pinckney, of South Carolina, rose and stated that he held in his hand
  certain resolutions which he would respectfully ask leave to offer for
  adoption by the House. He believed that it had always been customary for the
  House to adopt suitable tributes of respect to its deceased members. The S.C.
  delegation had heard, with deep regret, of the death of their colleague, the
  Hon. Thomas D. Singleton, and it was his painful duty to communicate that
  mournful information to the House. He died at Raleigh, whilst on his journey
  to the Capitol, whither he was hastening to assume his seat, and to discharge
  his duties, as a member of this body. ****
</p>
<p>
  With these few remarks, which he had felt it his duty to submit, in justice to
  the character of one whose memory deserved a far better tribute than any he
  could offer, he now proposed the following resolutions for the consideration
  of the House;
</p>
<p>
  Resolved, That we have received, with deep regret, the melancholy intelligence
  of the death of the Hon. THO’S D. SINGLETON, a Representative elect from the
  State of South Carolina.
</p>
<p>
  Resolved, That this House tender the expression of their sympathy to the
  relatives of the deceased, upon this mournful event; and that, in testimony of
  their regret for the loss, and respect for his memory, the members will wear
  crape upon the left arm for thirty days.
</p>
<p>The House then adjourned.</p>
<p>IN SENATE</p>
<p>THURSDAY, December 12.</p>
<p>
  A Message from the President was received by the hands of Mr Donalson, his Private Secretary, which was read as follows:
</p>
<p>
  I have attentively considered the resolution of the Senate of the 11th
  instant, requesting the President of the United States to communicate to the
  Senate ""a copy of the paper which has been published, and which purports to
  have been read by him to the heads of the Executive Departments, dated the
  18th day of September last, relating to the removal of the deposits of the
  public money from the Bank of the United States and its offices.""
  <br />
  The executive is a co-ordinate and independent branch of the Government
  equally with the Senate, and I have yet to learn under what constitutional
  authority that branch of the Legislature has a right to require of me an
  account of any communication, either verbally or in writing, made to the heads
  of Departments acting as a Cabinet council. As well might I be required to
  detail to the Senate the free and private conversations I have held with those
  officers on any subject relating to their duties and my own.
  <br />
  Feeling my responsibility to the American people, I am willing upon all
  occasions to explain to them the grounds of my conduct, and I am willing upon
  all proper occasions to give to either branch of the Legislature any
  information in my possession that can be useful in the execution of the
  appropriate duties confided to them.
  <br />
  Knowing the constitutional rights of the Senate, I shall be the last man under
  any circumstances to interfere with them. Knowing those of the Executive, I
  shall at all times endeavor to maintain them agreeably to the provisions of
  the Constitution and the solemn oath I have taken to support and defend it.
  <br />
  I am constrained, therefore, by a proper sense of my own self-respect and of
  the rights secured by the Constitution to the executive branch of the
  Government to decline a compliance with your request. ANDREW JACKSON
</p>
<p>After the message had been read,</p>
<p>
  Mr Clay said, that a call had been made on the President for a copy of a
  document which has been published and extensively circulated by the papers in
  this city—a document intimately connected with the safety of the treasure of
  the country. The call for it was made under the full conviction that the Senate
  ought to have that document. It had been refused, under the pretext that the
  rights of the Chief Magistrate were invaded by it. He always would be disposed
  to respect the rights of every public officer, but the President could have no
  more confidence in his rights, then I feel in the rights of the Senate. The
  right of the Senate to call for this paper was founded on the ground that the
  whole world was already in possession of it. It was made because the document
  was sent forth to the American people upon an all-important subject, and
  because it was the right of the Senate to have it. Nor was it made because the
  call was in violation of precedent or an established usage. But the President
  has refused to give us this document, and it was not necessary to proceed
  further in the pursuit. One result happens from it. The President don’t deny
  the genuineness of the paper. It is before the world, and as we have endeavored
  to get it, and it has been refused, I have a right to take the next best
  evidence of the document, and that is as it has been published in the official
  paper. In every instance, therefore, where I have occasion to use it, I shall
  avail myself of that publication of it, as genuine.
</p>
<p>
  Mr Grundy said he thought when the proposition was made, that it was a very
  unnecessary procedure.
</p>
<p>
  Here the presiding office interposed that the debate was out of order unless
  some motion was intended to be made.
</p>
<p>
  Mr Grundy said he intended to move, before he concluded, that the message be
  laid on the table; and then resumed—
</p>
<p>
  That he thought it unnecessary, because we only wanted evidence when facts had
  not come to our knowledge, or when they are denied.—Now, he believed that both
  friends and enemies admitted this document to be genuine—to be what it
  purported to be. He therefore had thought that nothing beneficial could result
  from this proposition, and this was what induced him to vote against it. The
  President has given his objection to complying with the call, and what is it?
  Why, that the Senate has asked for a private communication from the Chief
  Magistrate to his Cabinet. He, [Mr. G.] would never question the propriety of
  the motives of the Senator who wanted this information. But the President has.
</p>

<p>
  Mr Bibb, pursuant to notice given, presented certain joint resolutions
  providing or an alteration in the Constitution of the United States, in
  relation to the mode of electing the President, and Vice President, and then
  moved to lay the same on the table and print them. Mr. B. said he felt no
  disposition to press the consideration of the resolutions now, and therefore
  moved that the second Monday in January next be assigned for taking them up,
  and also the resolutions offered by Mr. Benton somedays since, on the same
  subject, at the same time; which was agreed to.
</p>
<p>
  Mr Clay moved the consideration of Mr Benton’s resolution, relative to the
  amount of moneys in deposite [sic] at particular periods in the Bank of the
  United States.
</p>
<p><em>Apparently a line is missing here</em></p>
<p>
  Said that it is a matter which you have no right to interrogate him about;
  and his opinion is, too, that to comply with the request would be setting a
  dangerous precedent. He [Mr G.] was not inclined to sat any thing on the
  subject of the removal of the deposits, when that matter should come up for
  consideration. But if he did, he could not, even if he were so disposed, speak
  of that paper as any other than a genuine one, or deny its authenticity. He
  therefore moved to key the message on the table; which was agreed to.

  all if contents, and three children, sons of Mr. I. from six to twelve years
  of age, perished in the flames. The fire broke out after the family had
  retired to bed, and made such progress before it was discovered, that nothing
  could be saved from the house, and even the [indecipherable] appeared lying by
  the bed sides. How it originated is not known, but it took in the second story
  where the children were sleeping; there were four of them; they were all
  awakened by the flames, and some of them started for the window, but only the
  eldest, a lad of 14 about reached it and leaped out; his brothers did not
  follow, and were lost. Their remains were found the next day in the ruins.
  Besides the loss to Mr. Irvine of his children, he has been entirely stripped
  of his effects, and has a daughter who escaped from the flames with simply a

Some further particulars relating to the conflict between the Mormonites and the

said that one Judge of the circuit, and several civil officers were thrown into

and the Lieut. Governor had been driven out of the county. Almost all the people
of the county are concerned on one side or the other, so that it is supposed

  In presenting to the public the October number of the LADY’S BOOK, the
  Proprietors feel much pleasure in inviting attention to a comparison between
  it and the preceding numbers. It will be perceived that a gradual, but decided
  improvement, has been effected in its embellishments; particularly in the
  department of costume fashions, which have been executed by KELLY; an artist
  who, in the Embellishment which accompanies this, has literally excelled
  himself; rendering the prints of Fashions of the LADY’S BOOK sufficiently
  excellent to compete with the best executed in London, and to surpass those of
  Paris. Hence, the public will perceive that the hopes of progressive
  improvement, which the proprietors of the Lady’s Book have expressed to their
  patrons, have been fully realized.
</p>
<p>
  A very material change is observable in the reading department of the Lady’s
  Book which improvement will proceed, to, at least, be sustained, by the
  exertions of its contributors; and, as a further expression of their gratitude
  to a patronizing community, the publication for January, 1834, will contain
  twenty-four additional pages, and the whole number will be exclusively devoted
  to and composed of ORIGINAL subjects—every article written expressly for the
  work.
</p>
<p>
  Among the contributors on this occasion may be enumerated Miss Leslie, author
  of the Prize Tale entitled “Mrs. Washington Potts”—Mrs. Hentz, author of the
  Prize Tragedy—the late Mrs. Gilbert—Joseph R. Chandler, Esq.—J.A. Shea, author
  of Adolph, Address to the Ocean, &amp;c.—the author of “A Tale of Fashionable
  Life”­—the author of “Sketches of a Jurist-Consult”—Y.P.—A.E.—and other
  well-known and popular writers, whose productions have given so peculiar a
  delight to the readers of the Lady’s Book. This publication has been always
  distinguished for its beautiful engravings of the Fashions, but it is the
  intention of the proprietors to render the one for January still more splendid
  than the previous ones. The public will perceive that, without heralding it by
  professions, a reference to past experience is the best promise of future
  exertions, which it shall be the publishers’ study to render both prompt and
  pleasing.

  The work was originally undertaken as an experiment to ascertain how far the
  public would encourage a magazine exclusively devoted to one object, viz. the
  intellectual instruction and moral improvement of the rising generation. In
  order to render the work extensively useful, a large circulation was
  necessary, and to ensure this, a very low price was indispensable.
</p>
<p>
  Every effort has been made to combine all these points in the Magazine, and we
  are happy to say that the success of our experiment thus far, is very
  encouraging. The circulation at present is nearly 15,000; a number entirely
  beyond that of any similar work ever undertaken in this country. But great as
  it is, such are the accumulated expenses of the publication, from the number
  of engravings, and from the care attending it, together with the very low
  price at which it is afforded, that we need a still more extended circulation
  to enable us fully to develope [sic] our plan, and bring into activity all the
  means of rendering the work still more efficient and useful.

  The idea of a state of society in which there shall not be an individual,

  approached. But how is this to be done? By an union of heart and hand, among
  the good and wise, in giving the fullest possible activity and energy, to

"		"Samuel Goodrich (1793-1860) was born in Ridgefield, Connecticut, the 6th of ten children and the son of a minister, in 1793. His career as a book publisher began in 1816. In the early 1820s Goodrich came to the conclusion that children as well as adults preferred to read truth rather than fancy and that it would be possible to present history, geography, science, etc. (truth) in such a way that it would be more interesting to children than fairies, giants and monsters. Based on this conclusion Goodrich moved his business to Boston and Peter Parley was born in 1827 with PETER PARLEY'S TALES ABOUT AMERICA. Goodrich expanded his publishing efforts to textbooks and magazines. His publications were so popular that he attracted imposters, particularly in England. Spurious Peter Parleys appeared everywhere, infuriating Goodrich, but he did not succeed in putting an end to them." from Contextual Notes at https://digitalcollections.lib.washington.edu/digital/collection/childrens/id/460/rec/9	Samuel Goodrich (inferred)

  For many months did that might man of God apply his discriminating and

  cou’d no longer contain his holy indignation against the upholders and
  apologists of this unrighteous system, he gave vent to his aching heart, and

  The following communication from a christian, a philanthropist, and a
  gentleman, we insert with pleasure. The language is energetic, occasionally
  severe, but we hold not ourself answerable for its severity. The circumstances
  of the case justify it. Cruel charges, unsubstantiated by the least shadow of
  evidence, have been too frequently brought against Abolitionists, and we have
  a right to demand the proof or a retraction, and if neither is given, he who
  makes those charge is, to say the least, a traducer of character.
</p>
<p><em>For the Unionist.</em></p>
<p>To the Editor of the Norwich Courier</p>
<p>
  SIR—I presume that you will agree with me in the sentiment that the editor of
  a public journal is under weighty responsibilities, and should suffer nothing
  to appear in the columns of his publication but with extreme caution. Opinions
  disseminated through the columns of a newspaper will, to a greater or less
  degree, influence the opinions of the reading community, and when the editor
  of a paper advocates any particular doctrine, he doubtless desires that his
  readers may adhere to the same doctrine. Great care therefore is necessary
  that a person in your connexion with community should disseminate thro’ that
  community, precepts which shall bear the test of truth—principles founded upon
  the strictest rules of justice and sound morality. You sir, I presume,
  professing to be governed by high and honorable motives, will readily assent
  to this, and at all times be willing to turn your attention to any thing which
  may have escaped your pen, and if any one of your readers should be so
  unfortunate as to differ from you in sentiment, you will, I presume,
  cheerfully examine the ground of their complaints, to be convinced, or to show
  some reason for a different course.
</p>
<p>
  I would request of you, sir, to re-peruse an article which appeared under your
  editorial head, Oct. 23d, in relation to Miss Crandall’s school and the
  sentiments of the abolitionists. I would ask you to do it calmly and
  dispassionately—
  <em>searching for the truth</em>
  —unbiased by opinions previously expressed, farther than you find
  <em>reason</em>
  to be your supporter.
</p>
<p>
  You say, “Although we think that Miss Crandall has a right to continue her
  school we are by no means friendly to the doctrines which are said to be
  taught in it; yet these doctrines can never be put down by persecution—they
  must be met by fair argument, and in such a contest they will prove wholly
  untenable.” I am glad to find that you have never denied the
  <em>right</em>
  of Miss Crandall to teach such a school—it is rather a matter or surprise to
  me, as it probably is to you, that New-England should contain an enlightened
  man who
  <em>would</em>
  deny that right. I know not what doctrines you have heard to be taught in that
  school, neither have you seen fit to inform the public. But you have said that
  <em>dangerous</em>
  doctrines are taught there that ought to be “put down.” If so, are not you,
  sir, bound to tell us what these doctrines are, as you wish to enlighten the
  public all you can—to overthrow these dangerous doctrines, and to free society
  from their contamination, will you not condescend to meet them by “fair
  argument,” as “in such a contest” you are confident “they will prove wholly
  untenable?” I am anxious to see, what I have never yet seen and feat I never
  shal, the attempt made to “put them down” by “fair argument,” instead of
  addled eggs, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
  You say again, “The least that can be said of the Abolition scheme is that it
  is an
  <em>insane</em>
  project—one which no man in the full possession and exercise of his faculties
  can contemplate as being practicable, or at the present time desirable.” I
  know, sir, it is very easy for a person, especially when under a little
  excitement, to go on and make severe accusations against his opponents, but it
  is quite another thing to show the reason of these accusations. I might say
  that the editor of the Norwich Courier was governed by passion and prejudice,
  with as much ease as you charge Abolitionists of insanity; and I doubt not,
  sir, that I should be able to substantiate my charge as soon as you yours. I
  have seen similar charges in your paper before, but I have never known of your
  being more particular. You are satisfied with making a general assertion, why
  not specify wherein this insanity consists? The leading doctrine of the
  Abolitionists is that no man has a right to hold his fellow man in bondage a
  single moment. Is this insane? Is it untrue? Is it a fact that man
  <em>has a right</em>
  to rob his fellow man of liberty—of
  <em>himself?</em>
  If he
  <em>has</em>
  such a right, tell me, sir, who gave him that right, and how long it is to
  continue. If he has a
  <em>right</em>
  to hold him in bondage
  <em>one</em>
  moment, how many moments may he have that right? But who are these insane
  Abolitionists? How long since this spirit of insanity come upon them? They are
  all around you—men of distinguished worth—of brilliant talents—to whom you,
  sire, in your highest estimation of yourself, never considered yourself worthy
  to be called an equal. You accuse them of forwarding a project which is not
  desirable. Do you pronounce them all hypocrites? No, you dare not, but they
  are
  <em>insane,</em>
  and therefore may be, for aught you know, sincere. But they are men of
  exemplary piety—men of fervent prayer—of extensive influence in promoting the
  cause of our Redeemer. You have not been accustomed to pronounce them
  insane—even now you are ready to quote their opinions upon other subjects and
  would place more confidence in their judgment than in your own. How happens it
  that their insanity is confined to this subject alone?
</p>
<p>
  You say, “The agitators appear to have bid adieu to common sense and a regard
  for the constitution and the laws,” &amp;c. I know not what you call bidding
  adieu to common sense, but one thing I know, that the leading Abolitionists in
  our country are the leading men in every other project to benefit the human
  race—men distinguished for their moral courage, seeking for the approval of
  God rather than for the favor of man. They have inquired for the path of duty
  and having ascertained it they have not failed to run in that path. Some,
  perhaps, might say that common sense in this respect is a disposition to act
  in a manner most congenial with popular feeling, If this is your definition of
  the term, I admit that they have ‘bid adieu to common sense,’ but as I
  understand the term they have most strictly adhered to it.
</p>
<p>
  As for the charge of their disregarding the constitution and the laws, I think
  it a very grave accusation to be brought against many of the best men of our
  country. But you, sir, are not the only one who has seen fit to make
  it—neither are you the only one who has made it without specifying what part
  of the constitution or what laws they disregard—and I must tell you, sire,
  that neither you nor all the wholesale accusers who you join
  <em>can</em>
  point out a single line of our constitution from which Abolitionists, as such,
  have departed. “Bid adieu to a regard for the constitution!” It is not
  true—and I here call upon you, sir, to clear your character from the
  imputation of falsehood. I would not say, sir, that you
  <em>intended</em>
  to assert an untruth, but I
  <em>do</em>
  say that you
  <em>have</em>
  asserted one, and unless you retract or substantiate it, the charge of
  falsehood must rest upon you. Is it unconstitutional to assert that it is
  morally wrong to hold slaves? Does the constitution of a free, republican
  people forbid that we should
  <em>speak against</em>
  chaining the mortal body and degrading the immortal mind? Is it against the
  constitution of a Christian people to declaim against the cruel system of
  slavery? —to say that it is contrary to the righteous laws of God—that it is
  inconsistent with the spirit of the gospel and the precepts of our Savior? Is
  it a fact that the
  <em>republicans</em>
  of the United States hold one sixth of their number in the chains of the
  verist despotism—that
  <em>two millions</em>
  of our fellow creatures are groaning under worse than Egyptian servitude—that
  <em>two million</em>
  of immortal souls are shut out from the light of science and closed to the
  entrance of one cheering ray from the Sun of Righteousness—and that when a few
  fearless men stand forth and say that these things are
  <em>wrong,</em>
  you, the editor of a public journal, cry out that in so saying they have “bid
  adieu to a regard for the constitution?” Tell me, sir, if these things are
  facts? O that you could tell me that they were not facts! But, alas! they are.
  We must not say that it is
  <em>wrong</em>
  to degrade the image of God to a level with the brutes that perish, for it is
  unconstitutional. Thank God!&nbsp; we have no such constitution as this! Shame
  on my countrymen! Shame on any republican asserting such a doctrine! I know
  the constitution
  <em>permits</em>
  the several states to hold slaves if they choose—but no where does it say that
  we
  <em>shall not</em>
  raise our voices against this abominable system. Wherein, then, have
  Abolitionists “bid adieu to a regard for the constitution?” Will you, sir,
  point out this treason, or cease longer to make an unfounded accusation?
</p>
<p>
  You say, “That this unprincipled opposition to the labors of the Colonization
  Society will raise up many warm friends to the latter there is abundant ground
  to hope.” As “unprincipled,"" sir, as these ‘agitators’ may be, I deem it no
  disparagement to you to say that they are men in the splendor of whose moral
  qualities you would be hardly visible, and whose names will be breathed with
  veneration by the virtuous and the good when yours shall have long been
  forgotten. But I am perfectly willing that you should, if you can, console
  yourself that by this opposition many warm friends will be raised up to the
  Colonization Society, but perhaps it may soften future disappointment, to
  inform you that many of those who have been ""warm friends” to that society are
  flocking around the Abolition standard, and however many ‘warm friends’ the
  Colonization Society may have, the cause of Abolition must forever stand. As
  long as justice reigns in heaven and sin is found on earth, so long will those
  be found who will exert themselves to hasten the triumph of the former and
  crush and extirpate the latter, and as sure as God is good so sure will he
  cause them to prosper.
</p>
<p>
  Again you say, “If the blacks are to be benefitted at all, it can only be
  accomplished by the aid of the Colonization Society, and their removal to
  Africa.” O that you had spared the penning of that sentence! What principle do
  you mean to advocate? Into what would you convert our happy land? What, sir,
  shall we think of the man, professing to be governed by that religion which
  commands us to love our neighbor as ourselves, who tells us that here are two
  and a half millions of immortal beings among us, degraded and wretched, and if
  they “are to be benefitted at all” it must be by “their removal to Africa?”
  What, in the name of God, is the reason they cannot be benefitted here? What
  but that you and some of your brother editors are so wickedly prejudiced
  against them that you are determined they
  <em>shall not be?</em>
  They
  <em>can</em>
  be benefitted here—they
  <em>will</em>
  be benefitted here. The number of blacks in this country will never be less
  than at the present moment—for in the first place we have not the means to
  make them less, increasing as they do 70,000 per year, and in the second place
  if we had the means of carrying them to Africa they do not want to go. They
  must always remain with us unless we serve them as we have served the poor
  Indians, and though you may continue to assert that they must always remain
  degraded, yet every true Christian will rejoice that God in his good providence
  has ordered it otherwise.

Sixth Report of the American Temperance Society	The Unionist	Allied Reform Movements - Temperance	"<p align=""center"">
  SIXTH REPORT OF THE AMERICAN
  <strong>TEMPERANCE SOCIETY</strong>
  ,
</p>
<p align=""center""><em>Continued</em></p>
<p>
  IV. Laws which authorize the licensing of men to traffic in ardent spirit,
  violate the first principles of political economy, and are highly injurious to
  the wealth of a nation.
</p>
<p>
  The wealth of a nation consists of the wealth of all the individuals that
  compose it. The sources of wealth are labor, land, and capital. The last is
  indeed the product of the two former; but as it may be used to increase their
  value, it is considered by writers on political economy, as one of the
  original sources of national wealth. Whatever lessons either of these, or
  their productiveness when employed upon each other, lessens the wealth of the
  country. Capital may be employed in two ways; either to produce new capital,
  or merely to afford gratification, and in the production of that gratification
  he consumed, without repealing its value. The first may be called capital, and
  the last expenditure. These will of course bear inverse proportions to each
  other. If the first be large, the last must be small, and vice versa. Without
  any change of the amount of wealth, capital will be increased by the lessened
  by the increase of expenditure. Although the manner of dividing makes no
  difference with the present amount of national wealth, it makes great
  difference with the future amount; as it alters materially the sources of
  producing it, the means of an equal, or increased reproduction.
</p>
<p>
  For instance, a man fond of noise and excited agreeably by the hearing of it,
  pays a dollar for gunpowder, and touches fire to it. He occasions an entire
  loss of that amount of property. Although the powder maker and the merchant,
  may both have received their pay, if it has not benefitted the man, to him it
  has been a total loss; and if the sale of it was more profitable than would
  have been the sale of some useful article, it has been an entire loss to the
  community. And if by the explosion the man is burnt, partially loses his
  reason, is taken off a time from business, and confined by sickness to his
  bed, must have nurses, physicians, &amp;c. the loss is still increased. And if
  he never recovers fully his health, or reason, suffers his social affections
  and moral sensibility, becomes less faithful in the education of his children,
  and they are more exposed to temptation and ruin, and he is never again as
  able or willing to be habitually employed in productive labor, the nation
  loses equal to the amount of all these put together. And if his example leads
  other men to spend, and to suffer in the same way, the loss is still farther
  increased; and so on, through all its effects.
</p>
<p>
  And even though the powder maker and the merchant have made enormous profit,
  this does not prevent the loss to the community; any more than the profit of
  lottery gamblers, or counterfeiters of the public coin, prevents loss to the
  community. Nor does it meet the case, to say that the property changes hands.
  This is not true. The man who sold the powder made a profit of only a part
  even of the money which the other man paid for it; while he lost not only the
  whole, but vastly more. The whole of the original cost was only a small part
  of the loss to the buyer, and for the nation. The merchant gained nothing of
  the time, and other numerous expenses, which the buyer lost; nor does he in
  any way remunerate the community for that loss.
</p>
<p>
  Suppose that man, instead of buying the powder, had bought a pair of shoes;
  and that the tanner and the shoemaker had gained in this case, what the
  powder-maker and the merchant gained in the other; and that by the use of the
  shoes, though they were finally worn out, the man gained twice as much as he
  gave for them; without any loss of health, or reason, social affection, or
  moral susceptibility; and without any of the consequent evils.—Who cannot see
  that it would have increased his wealth, and that of the nation, without
  injury to any, and have promoted the benefit of all.
</p>
<p>
  This illustrates the principle with regard to ardent spirit. A man buys a
  quantity of it, and drinks it; when he would be, as the case with every man,
  in all respects better without it. It is to him an entire loss. The merchant
  may have made a profit of one quarter of the cost, but the buyer loses the
  whole; and he loses the time employed in obtaining and drinking it. He loses,
  also, and the community loses, equal to all its deteriorating effects upon his
  body and mind, his children, and all who come under his influence. His land
  becomes less productive. The capital of course produced by this land and labor
  is diminished; and thus the means are diminished of future reproduction. And
  by the increase of expenditure in proportion to the capital, it is still
  farther diminished, till to meet the increasingly disproportionate expenses,
  the whole is often taken, and the means of future reproduction are entirely
  exhausted. And if there is no seed to sow, there is of course no future
  harvest. This is but a simple history of what is taking in thousands of cases
  continually; and of what is the tendency of the traffic in ardent spirit from
  beginning to end. It lessens the productiveness of land and labor, and of
  course diminishes the amount of capital; while in proportion, it increases the
  expenditure, and thus in both ways is constantly exhausting the means of
  future production. And this is its tendency, in all its bearing, in proportion
  to the quantity used, from the man who takes only his glass, to the man who
  takes his quart a day. It is a palpable and gross violation of all correct
  principles of political economy; and from beginning to end, tends to diminish
  all the sources of national wealth.

"	Might we be sensing William's influence here? The word “diminish” is twice spelled “dimish” in this last paragraph. I corrected that in this transcription. 	This is a continuation from previous editions of the paper. Because I cannot tell what <em>The Unionist</em> would have excerpted, I have not included any more of it at this time. This particular excerpt buttresses my published contention that the students at the Canterbury Female Academy were reading advanced philosophy. While I disagree with the political economic analysis forwarded here, it is sophisticated for its time. The meeting of the American Temperance Society was held in May 1833, and the publication came out of Boston. This particular excerpt begins on p. 46 of the pamphlet, near the bottom of the page, through p. 48, most of the way down the page.

Wilberforce Prize Essay	The Unionist	Abolition; Education	"<p align=""center""><strong>Wilberforce Prize Essay.</strong></p>
<p align=""center"">A NEW AND IMPORTANT SUGGESTION.</p>
<p align=""center"">CHRISTIAN SLAVERY.</p>
<p align=""center"">Another Reformation in the Church must be attempted.</p>
<p align=""center"">
  “Attempt great things—expect great things.” (The voice of the departed. [sic
  no close parentheses]
</p>
<p>
  IN consequence of the light poured on the public, and the church, by the
  spirited exertions of philanthropic individuals, a great change, in relation
  to intoxicating liquors, has been produced. The eye, heart, and hand of
  christian faith looks, prays, and acts for its completion.
</p>
<p>
  But another reformation is needed in the church. It must be as separate from
  slavery, as from intemperance. The nation groans under the burden and misery
  and guilt of both these sins. It is the solemn duty of the church to clear
  itself from both these tremendous crimes. This is not addressed to the world,
  for the world legalizes the traffic in rum, and in the bodies and souls of
  men. But it is addressed to the children of God, who, if they know and do
  their duty, can have no possible connection with either of these trades. If
  increasing light has shown that christians ought not to buy and sell ardent
  spirits, much more it is believed, will increasing light show that christians
  ought not to buy human beings.
</p>
<p>
  The Rev John Newton, even after he became pious, transported Africans in
  chains across the Atlantic, to be sold with their posterity into slavery.
  Could he have been a true christian, and have no upbraidings of conscience
  while so engaged? Yes. How is it possible? It was legal, and, at that time,
  honorable, and his mind was not enlightened.—Afterwards when it was he
  lamented his error. So there are in our country those who buy and sell their
  fellow beings, who, if their minds were enlightened, would lament and
  relinquish it.
</p>
<p>
  A few years ago, a man, whose whole daily earnings were required by his
  family, set up forty nights to run a distillery for forty dollars, which he
  gave to build a house of worship.—How could he think that money obtained by
  changing the bread of the poor, into the liquid fire of death, acceptable to
  God? Because his mind was in darkness. Would he do it now? No. Neither would
  the church now receive it. Why? Because the light of the temperance
  reformation has burst forth.
</p>
<p>
  Christians! who have promised supreme obedience to Him, that tasted death for
  every man,: and more for the rich man, who, in a superb dress, rides in a
  superb carriage, to a superb church, to worship in superb style, than for the
  poor African, who pulls cotton in the “fields of Alabama, and naked as in the
  hour of birth, trembles under the blasts of mid winter”—on you is this call
  for a reformation in the church of that God, who declares himself no respector
  [sic] of persons.—Why do you exclude the dealer in ardent spirits from the
  communion table, and invite to it the dealer in human flesh? This could not,
  would not be, if there had been half so much effort made to show the utter
  abominations of christian slavery, as there has been to show the abominations
  of christian drunkenness. Whatever maybe the event of slavery and intemperance
  in the world a sufficiency of light will show, and cause to be removed
  these shocking deformities of the christian church. One denomination has
  already raised thousands of dollars to assist their brethren in becoming free
  from the deep stains of this awful sin. When will other denominations be
  equally sincere and active to cleanse themselves from this pollution? The
  answer is plain. When they are as conscientious and as much enlightened.
</p>
<p>
  To have light poured on this subject as its importance demands, it is proposed
  to raise fifty dollars, as a premium for the best essay on this deeply
  interesting subject. When the church is pure, we may then expect the smiles
  and approbation of heaven on our now almost divided land. And oh! May none
  refuse their mite to reward the close application of time and talents to this
  most vitally important theme; for it is believed the temperance reformation
  commenced in this way.

  Donations will be received by the Editors of the Genius of Temperance, and the
  Editor of the Emancipator, 126, Nassau street. A part of the money has already
  been raised by a few ladies in Massachusetts. It is hoped that others, who are
  opposed to slavery in the church of Christ, will speedily forward enough to
  make it up to $50, when the sum will be given to him who shall show most
  conclusively to the christian church and to christian ministers, their duty to
  “Break every yoke.” The essays which shall be written for the prize, are to be

Charles Denison, editor of <em>The Emancipator</em>, and William Goodell of <em>The Genius of Temperance</em> were the two designated people to whom to send entries. Both were good friends of the cause and of the Canterbury Female Academy. Denison had trained William Burleigh in the printing business in 1830-31 when he was editing the <i>The Stonington Phenix</i> in New London county, Connecticut. John Newton was a former slave trader who had a religious conversion to Christianity, and denounced the slave trade. He is most famous as the author of the words to the song "Amazing Grace."

"		Philip Pearl Jr. has a checkered history in the saga of the Canterbury Female Academy. His daughter Hannah attended the first version of the Academy, before the change to Black students. Philip Pearl Jr. was an elected legislator who helped to draft the law in 1833, and lobbied it through the Assembly. He was perceived as Andrew Judson's most important ally in Connecticut state politics. However, he was converted to anti-slavery by Theodore Dwight Weld, and in 1837 led the effort to repeal the Black Law! On the petition from his town of Hampton, he signed the petition at the top in bold pen.

  done at last, and it’s ready for ‘em at Lilly, Wait, Colman &amp; Holden’s

  when they find that we put our heads together about it, they wont [sic] be
  afraid but what it’s done right. I got some of the best picter [sic] makers
  there is in Boston to make some picters [sic] for it. And they’ve put in a
  picter of me, and one of General Jackson, and a few more of us, and some queer

  (and as we think, with a sore head,) at the same time declaring that is, (the

<em>on fire</em>, in a place and under circumstances which rendered the origin of it
inexplicable. The flame and smoke burst out from the corner of one of the rooms
farthest from the chimney and fire place, but the inmates of the house with the
assistance of the neighboring villagers succeeded in putting it out. This
would readily be supposed to be accidental, had not public threats been
previously made to <em>effectually break up Miss C’s school.</em>
 If, as is suspected, it shall prove to be the work of any of those opposed
to the efforts of this young lady—they may take back the ignoble epithet
of <em>‘incendiary’</em> with which they have frequently hailed the abolitionists, and wear it like
Cain, branded on their foreheads.—

<em>Norwich Republican</em> vs. <em>Windham Advertiser</em>	<em>Norwich Republican</em>	Dispute on attitude toward <emThe Unionist</em> between the <em>Norwich Republican</em> and the <em>Windham Advertiser</em>.	"<p>From the Windham County Advertiser</p>
<p>
  “In the last Norwich Republican, some remarks appear respecting the late fire
  on the premises of Miss Crandall, in the course of which the editor of this
  paper is alluded to in a manner that will, unless explained, greatly lessen
  that confidence and respect, which we have hitherto cherished towards the
  Republican, and our faith in the integrity of its editor. In the article of
  which we speak, an “assertion” is attributed to us, which we never made,
  either in public or in private. (a) it also falsely states that we have
  declined making any disavowal” of a knowledge of the [indecipherable]
  “affair.” Such a disavowal <em>has</em> been made, in a letter to Miss Crandall, which has since been published. (b)
  The Republican had better search for <em>facts,</em> before it asserts any thing on the authority of the Unionist; (c) and when those facts are found, the writer of the article of which we complain, will be made fully acquainted with the injustice he has done us. (d)
</p>
<p>
  (a)We have not the Advertiser at our command in which the assertion referred
  to, is published. Consequently we are not convinced that we were mistaken.
</p>
<p>
  (b)We are rejoiced to hear this. Such disavowal have never met our eye,
  although we seldom fail to give the Advertiser a thorough examination.
</p>
<p>
  (c) At present we entertain a good opinion of Messrs. Burleighs. Their paper
  (the Unionist) aside from its practical character, appears to be conducted
  with much discernment. Its junior editor, Mr. Wm. Burleigh was taught the
  rudiments of printing by ourself—and notwithstanding his disobedience caused
  us to discharge him from our employ, yet commands our respect. He appears to
  be possessed of talents, which, with proper cultivation, may enable him to
  obtain an enviable reputation. Give “the devil his due,” is an old saying,
  brother Holbrook.
</p>
<p>
  (d)We are sorry, very sorry, if any remarks of ours have caused thee to feel
  unpleasant. We can truly say that nothing was more foreign from our
  intentions. Help us to the “facts,” brother, and they shall be duly published
  in the Republican.”
</p>
"		Here we can perceive how attitudes are shifting towards <emThe Unionist</em>. Differences are being voiced between the <em>Norwich Republican</em> and the <em>Windham Advertiser</em> concerning the conduct of <em>The Unionist</em>. Tidbit that Burleigh studied printing under the editor of the <em>Norwich Republican</em>. Indeed, the editor of that paper, The William Faulkner (1808-1878) had hired Burleigh as an apprentice around 1829-1830, but had let him go due to disobedience. In the <em>New York Daily Tribune</em> obituary for William Burleigh (March 20, 1871), they tell the story from Burleigh's perspective, indicating that "he liked the business, but not the proprietor" and left after eight months.

  Various were the conjectures concerning the cause of her sudden disappearance,
  and when at last they ventured to question Matilda, she replied with a great
  many signs and a few hypocritical tears, that her father had placed her under
  the care of his sister-in-law, the widow of an eminent physician, thinking her
  experience and virtuous example might be of service to Emily, that she was
  grieved for the cause, and wished not to be question on the subject. Thus, by
  her false insinuations, she deprived her of the esteem of the world—that world
  which will one day <em>worship</em> and the next <em>stab</em>
  you. Not contented with this, she persuaded Mr. Minnette to disinherit his
  daughter, and make a will in favor of the little George, but her cruelty was
  not to go unpunished. By some unforeseen losses in trade Mr. Minnette became
  bankrupt, and was obliged to sell his splendid establishment in —— street, and
  remove to a small house which belonged to Emily’s mother, and which was the
  only property he could not be deprived of. But to return to Emily.
</p>
<p>
  The picture of former days would sometimes rise, and appear like a fairy
  dream, from which she had been too soon awakened. She thought of the kind
  mother who had been ever ready to gratify her childish wishes—and of Edward,
  too, she thought much. Would he believe his sister’s falsehoods? was a
  question that often perplexed her. And were there no mingling of resentment in
  these recollections? Not any. Her heart had been taught a better discipline.
</p>
<p>
  Two years passed away, and Emily found peace, if not happiness. She was now
  twenty-one years old, and it was in her power to retaliate her injuries, by
  turning her father out of her house, which was now in her possession; but
  instead of this she wrote a long and kind letter, entreating him to occupy it
  as long as he wished.
</p>
<p>
  Having but little to engage her attention, Emily offered to teach a school for
  the children of the village. For this purpose, a room was fitted up in a small
  light building, erected near the river for the convenience of washing. During
  her residence with her kind aunt, it had been her favorite care to ornament
  and improve it. She had planted all around it the rose of cassia, jessamine,
  honeysuckle and grape vines. Their mingled blossoms and intertwining branches
  formed a luxuriant drapery, which soon became one mass of living verdure. From
  this little nest of flowers, an avenue, shaded by old elms, led down to the
  river, whose smooth surface was broken into ripples by the dipping branches of
  the weeping willow, as its waters went sparkling and gleaming along in their
  noiseless beauty. Here, in pleasant weather, Emily often ranged her scholars,
  in the open air; and then there were bright eyes and happy faces, for children
  do not love the confinement of a school room. The exercises of the day were
  generally concluded with a hymn and prayer, in which all were taught to join.
</p>
<p>
  It was near the close of a delightful day in June, and their melodious voices
  were just breaking the stillness of that beautiful solitude, when a gentleman,
  attracted by the sound, came to the opposite bank, and, concealed by the
  shade, listened with intense delight to the infant warblers.
</p>
<p>
  The last note died away, and a solemn pause ensued. “Now, my dear little
  children,” said Emily, “will you join me, with your whole hearts, in a prayer
  to our Heavenly Father who has watched over and protected us through the day.”
  She then kneeled down on the green earth, and was soon encircled by her cherub
  band of scholars, who also knelt and softly repeated, after their youthful
  instructress, The Lord’s Prayer. Then came the fervent “amen”—“Amen!” repeated
  their innocent lips, and “Amen!” echoed the green hills. Then, slowly, they
  all arose, kissed Emily, one by one, crossed the little bridge, and
  disappeared.
</p>
<p>
  But the stranger yet remained. It was Edward Brumiere, once the friend of
  Emily—and if he had ever doubted her, could he any longer question the
  goodness and purity of the beautiful being before him? It was impossible. A
  moment, and he was at her side. Surprise deepened the rose on her cheek, and
  she confessed the pleasure she felt in again meeting him. She extended her
  hand to him with a cordial smile, for she had not yet learned to hide her
  feelings under the mask of indifference.
</p>
<p>
  “I come from your father, my dear Emily. He is not very well, and feels the
  want of your kindness and good nursing.”
</p>
<p>
  “But where is my ———mother?” she enquired, hesitatingly. “She is obliged to
  divide her attentions between him and your little brother, who has been
  sometime ill, of a lingering complaint, which they fear will terminate in a
  consumption. But are you quite willing to forget your resentment?” “I have
  none.” “Your injuries then?” “I freely forgive them as I hope to be forgiven.”
</p>
<p>
  “Do you know their extent? Driven from your home, calumniated, disinherited,
  by one who pledged herself your friend.”
</p>
<p>
  While enumerating these, he closely watched her countenance, and finding there
  no expression but forgiving love, he continued, “or do you not feel their
  force?” An unbidden tear fell down her cheek, silently refuting the charge of
  insensibility.
</p>
<p>
  Love sprung in his heart spontaneous; and tenderly taking her hand, he said
  with much emotion, “Amiable girl!—have you no connection with earth, that you
  have divested yourself of human passions and frailties.”
</p>
<p>
  “Afflictions have been sanctified to me, and have taught me that hatred and
  happiness cannot exist in the same bosom.”
</p>
<p>
  “Matilda is my sister; forgive me, Emily! I believed what she said of you! I
  could almost <em>hate</em> her for <em>your</em> sake, had you not given me a better example.”
</p>
<p>
  “It is perfectly natural to believe the assertions of those we love; but I
  hope my study may be to contradict the tongue of slander by my conduct. Anger
  so blinds our reason, that Matilda might imagine me the unkind, guilty
  creature she represents me."" Thus saying, she led the way to the house, where
  she introduced Edward to her aunt.
</p>
<p>The next morning found them at Mr. Minnette’s door.</p>
<p>
  Edward remained in the parlor, that he might put no restraint upon the
  feelings of either party, while Emily was shown to her father’s room. She
  clung round his neck—he embraced her, and she once more felt happy in his
  returning love.
</p>
<p>
  The open door of an adjoining room discovered Matilda, bending over the bed of
  her sick child, with all a mother’s fondness in her looks. In her deep anxiety
  the predominant expression of unbending pride was lost; and instead, there
  seemed something like repentance, nay, even kindness as her eye rested on
  Emily.
</p>
<p>
  From this time, Emily divided her cares between her father and brother, and
  determined by her attentions to merit the love of her family. Perhaps she was
  more condescending than some, yet none thought her mean-spirited, or weak, or
  respected her the less; but all admired the forgiving spirit she displayed.
</p>
<p>
  Mr. Minnette soon recovered, which gave some reason to suspect that his
  disorder originated in remorse; and now, Emily transferred all her attentions
  to her suffering brother. She had, while with her aunt (who was the medical
  adviser of the whole village) acquired considerable knowledge of roots and
  herbs, and these she successfully employed in his recovery.
</p>
<p>
  Every day she carried the sufferer out of doors in her arms for the benefit of
  exercise and fresh air, of which Matilda, by a mistake in the art of nursing,
  had deprived him. He soon felt the good effect of the change, and the
  delighted mother saw once more the glow of health upon his cheek, and
  returning activity in his tiny limbs.
</p>
<p>
  Matilda’s haughty spirit had been broken down by adversity, and Emily’s
  conduct had shamed “the offending spirit” out of her. Her understanding was
  naturally good, but it had been perverted by a faulty education, dictated by
  an injudiciously fond parent. A train of concurring circumstances roused her
  better feelings and they triumphed over the errors of education and the
  habitual follies of many years! and she bent before the altar of her God, a
  repentant woman and a humble and sincere christian. And now, from being the
  most wretched, they became, proverbially, the most united and happy family in
  New-York. Having performed her duties at home, Emily, according to promise,
  returned to her aunt, accompanied by Edward, who by the consent of all parties
  had become her betrothed husband.
</p>
<p>
  “Let us be married, Emily,” said he, “on the anniversary of the river scene;
  then I shall unite in one the two most interesting events of my life, my
  marriage and the event which led to it.”
</p>
<p>
  A year from that day, Emily became the wife of Edward—and each succeeding one
  finds her in the midst of love and happiness surrounded by her family of
  little ones, to whom Edward annually repeats the Tale of Forgiveness.

From Dymond’s Essays on Political Rights and Obligations	<em>The Unionist</em>	Religion and Philosophy; Allied Reform Movements - Peace	"<p align=""center""><strong>POLITICAL.</strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong>———</strong></p>
<p align=""center"">From Dymond’s Essays on Political Rights and Obligations</p>
<p align=""center"">II.</p>
<p align=""center"">
  “POLITICAL POWER IS RIGHTLY EXERCISED ONLY WHEN IT SUBSERVES THE WELFARE OF
  COMMUNITY”
</p>
<p>
  This proposition is consequent of the truth of the last. The community which
  has the right to withhold power, delegates it, of course, for its own
  advantage. If in any case its advantage is not consulted, then the object for
  which it was delegated is frustrated—or in simple words, the measure which
  does not promote the public welfare is not right. It matters nothing whether
  the community have delegated specifically so much power for such and such
  purposes: the power, <em>being possessed,</em> entails the obligation. Whether a sovereign derives absolute authority for a
  year, the principles of their duty are the same. The obligation to employ it
  only for the public good, is just as real and just as great in one case as in
  the other. The Russian and the Turk have the same right to require that the
  power of their rulers shall be so employed, as the Englishman or American.
  They may not be able to assert this right, but that does not affect its
  existence nor the ruler’s duty,—nor his responsibility to that
  <em>Almighty</em>
  Being before whom he must give an account of his stewardship. These
  reasonings, if they needed confirmation, derive it from the fact that the
  Deity imperatively requires us, according to our opportunities, to
  <em>do good</em>
  to man.
</p>
<p>
  But, how ready soever men are to admit the truth of this proposition as a
  proposition, it is very commonly disregarded in practice; and a vast variety
  of motives and objects direct the conduct of governments which have no
  connection with the public weal. Some <em>pretensions</em> of consulting the public weal are, indeed, usual. It is not to be supposed
  that when public officers are pursuing their own schemes and interests, they
  will <em>tell</em> the people that they disregarded theirs. When we look over the history of a
  christian nation, it is found that a large proportion of these measures which
  are most prominent in it, had little tendency to subserve, and did not
  subserve the public good. In practice it is very often forgotten for what
  purpose governments are instituted. If a man were to look over twenty
  treaties, he would probably find that half of them had very little to do with
  the welfare of the respective communities. He might find a great deal about
  Charles’ rights, and Frederick’s honor, and Louis’ possessions, and Francis’
  interests,—as if the proper subjects of international arrangements were those
  which respected rulers rather than communities. If a man looks over the state
  papers which inform him of the origin of a war, he will probably fund that
  they agitate questions about Most Christian and Most Catholic Kings, and High
  Mightinesses, and Imperial Majesties,—questions, however, in which Frenchmen,
  and Spaniards, and Dutch, and Austrians, are very little interested or
  concerned, or at any rate much less interested than they are in avoiding the
  quarrel.
</p>
<p>
  Governments commonly trouble themselves unnecessarily and too much with the
  politics of other nations. A prince should turn his back towards other
  countries and his face towards his own,—just as the proper place of a
  landholder is upon his own estates and not upon his neighbor’s. If governments
  were wise, it would ere long be found, that a great portion of the endless and
  wearisome succession of treaties, and remonstrances, and embassies, and
  alliances, and memorials, and subsidies, might be dispensed with, with so
  little inconvenience, and so much benefit, that the world would wonder to
  think to what futile ends they had been busying and how needlessly they had
  been injuring themselves.
</p>
<p>
  No doubt, the immoral and irrational system of international politics which
  <em>generally</em> obtains, makes the path of one government more difficult than it would
  otherwise be; and yet it is probable that the most efficacious way of inducing
  another government to attend to its proper business, would be to attend to our
  own. It is not sufficiently considered, nor indeed is it sufficiently
  <em>known</em>, how powerful is the influence of uprightness and candor in conciliating the
  good officers of other men. Overreaching and chicanery in one person, induce
  overreaching and chicanery in another. Men distrust those whom they perceive
  to be unworthy of confidence. Real integrity is not without its being vouched in the
  hearts of others; and they who maintain it are treated with confidence,
  because it is seen that confidence can be safely reposed. Besides, he who
  busies himself with the politics of foreign countries, like the busy bodies in
  a petty community does not fail to offend. In the last century, our own
  country was so much of a busy body, and had involved itself in such a
  multitude of treaties and alliances, that it was found, I believe, quite
  impossible to fulfil one without, by that very act, violating another. This,
  of course, would offend. In private life that man passes through the world
  with the least annoyance and the greatest satisfaction, who confines his
  attention to its proper business, that is, generally, to his own: and who can
  tell why the experience of nations should in this case by different from that
  of private men? In a rectified state of international affairs, half a dozen
  princes on a continent would have little more occasion to meddle with one
  another than half a dozen neighbors in a street.
</p>
<p>
  But indeed, <em>Communities</em> frequently contribute to their own injury. If governors are ambitious, or
  resentful, or proud, so, often, are the people;—and the public good has often
  been sacrificed by the public, with astonishing preposterousness, to jealousy
  or vexation. Some merchants are angry at the loss of a branch of trade; they
  urge the government to interfere; memorials and remonstrances follow to the
  state of whom they complain;—and so, by that process of exasperation which is
  quite natural when people think that high language and a high attitude is
  politic, the nations soon begin to fight. The merchants applaud the spirit of
  their rulers,—while in one year they lose more by war than they would have
  lost by the want of the trade for twenty; and before peace returns, the nation
  has lost more than it would have lost by the continuance of the evil for
  twenty centuries. Peace at length arrives, and the government begins to devise
  means of repairing the mischiefs of the war. Both government and people
  reflect very complacently on the wisdom of their measures,—forgetting that
  their conduct is only that of a man who wantonly fractures his own leg with a
  club, and then boasts to his neighbors how dexterously he limps to a surgeon.
</p>
<p>
  Present expedients for present occasions, rather than a wide embracing and
  far-seeing policy, is the great characteristic of European politics. We are
  hucksters who cannot resist the temptation of a present sixpence, rather than
  merchants who wait for their profits for the return of a fleet. Si quaeris
  monumentum, circumspice. [If you are looking for a monument, look around.]
  Look at the condition of either of the continental nations, and consider what
  it might have been if even a short line of princes had attended to their
  proper business,—had directed their solicitude to the improvement of the moral
  and social and political condition of the people. Who has been more successful
  in this huckster policy than France? And what is France, and what are the
  French people at the present hour?—Why, as it respects real welfare they are
  not merely surpassed, they are left at an immeasurable distance, by a people
  who sprung up but as yesterday,—by a people whose land, within the memory of
  our grand-fathers, was almost a wilderness, long since France boasted of her
  greatness. Such results have a cause. It is not possible that systems of
  policy can be good, of which the effects are so bad. I speak not of particular
  measures or of individual acts of ill policy,—these are not likely to be the
  result of the condition of man,—but of the whole international system,—a
  system of irritability, and haughtiness, and temporary expedients; a system of
  most unphilosophical principles, and from which christianity is practically
  almost excluded. Here is the evidence of fact before us. We know what a
  sickening detail the history of Europe is. And it is obvious to remark, that
  the system which has given rise to such a history must be vicious and mistaken
  in its fundamental principles. The same class of history will continue to
  after generations unless these principles are changed,—unless philosophy and
  christianity obtain a greater influence in the practice of government; unless,
  in a word, governments are content to do their proper business, and to leave
  that which is not their business, undone.
</p>
<p>
  When such principles are acted upon we may reasonably expect a rapid
  advancement in the whole condition of the world. Domestic measures which are
  now postponed to the more stirring occupations of legislators, will be found
  to be of incomparably greater importance than they. A wise code of criminal
  law will be found to be of more consequence and interest than the acquisition
  of a million square miles of territory;—A judicious encouragement of general
  education will be of more value than all the “glory” that has been acquired
  from the days of Alfred till now. Of moral legislation, however it will be our
  after business to speak; Meanwhile the lover of mankind has some reason for
  gratulation in perceiving indications that governments will hereafter direct
  their attention more to the objects for which they are invested with power.
  The statesmen who promotes this improvement will be what many statesmen have
  been <em>called</em> —a great man. That government only is great which promotes the prosperity of
  its own people; and that people only are prosperous, who are wise and happy.

"We are in the midst of a revolution"	<em>The Unionist</em>	National News	"<p>
  “We are in the midst of a revolution,” was the startling, and true as
  startling, declaration, with which Mr. Clay commenced his speech in the Senate
  some weeks ago. We are in the midst of a political revolution, which is
  silently but fatally sapping the principles of our free institutions, and
  consolidating the whole action of the Government, into the will of the
  executive. “The President is far above the reach of anything said in this
  House,” said Mr Polk; and a passive House of Representatives—the people’s own
  House—hear without resenting the insolent assertion, and by their silence
  admit its truth. Yet the minister or favorite, who, on the floor of the
  English House of Commons, or of the French Chamber of Deputies, should hazard
  such a vaunt of the crowned monarchs of either of those realms, would be put
  to silence and to shame, by the indignant voices of men of
  <em>all</em>
  parties. He would, in those
  <em>limited monarchies</em>
  be told that the king, like the humblest man in the kingdom, was the subject
  of the laws and the creature of opinion; and that it belonged not to him, or
  to any one for him, to claim exemption from that dependence upon the people’s
  representatives, ordained for the common good o all. In this
  <em>freest of republics,</em>
  infallibility in judgement and in action; the right of constructing according
  to his own will all laws, and of dismissing at his own will all functionaries
  who see not with his eyes; and finally entire independence of the opinion of
  the Legislatures; are openly claimed for the Executive; and all who demur in
  the least to this sweeping claim, or who suggest that, even with the best
  motives, and the greatest caution, there may be error or mistake in some given
  act, are denounced as enemies to the “venerable President,” and forthwith
  trampled under foot as rebels and traitors—not to the country, or to
  freedom—but to
  <em>the</em>
  party. We are then in the midst of a revolution, which is habituating us fast
  and fatally to disregard all those checks and balances which the wise
  contrivers of the Constitution, thought sufficient and availing, to secure the
  independence of each department in its proper sphere; and to look to the
  Executive head alone, as the fountain of all honor, profit and power. Nor is
  it to politics alone that the revolution is confined. In a country like this,
  where every citizen does, or may if he pleases, take a part in its public
  affairs, no great revolution in politics can be effected without a
  corresponding revolution in morals. Accordingly we find that the spirit of
  party, which now directs all its discipline and energy to sustain allegiance
  and devotion to the person of the President—be his measures what they
  may—infects the judgement or corrupts the principles of men on other subjects,
  and the recklessness with which conscience is outraged, in approving political
  measures, which in fact it disapproved—may come at last to pervert entirely
  the warning voice of that secret monitor.
</p>
<p>
  It would seem the very “error of the moon” that men and doctrines such as
  these we have this alluded to, should find a place and a bearing in the
  Legislative halls of a people so practical, and which flatters itself with
  being so enlightened, as ours—were it not that a sufficient earthly
  explanation is at hand in the cause we referred to in the outset of these
  remarks—the spirit of party—which, so that implicit and uncompromising
  obedience be rendered to its mandates, is little solicitous about any other
  qualifications, in the instruments it puts forth. Truly indeed did Mr Binney
  conclude, that the question now in issue in this country is, whether this
  “spirit of party” be not more fatal to free institutions here, than the spirit
  of despotism has proved elsewhere. Its inevitable tendency, at any rate, is to
  degrade, even though it may not wholly destroy;—and in that stage of the
  question, most certainly, this State now is.—

Legislature of Pennsylvania publishing Washington's Farewell Address	<em>The Unionist</em>	National News; Miscellaneous Filler	"<p>
  We have pleasure in noticing the following incident in the proceedings of the
  Legislature of Pennsylvania, which certainly goes far to show that the
  politics of that important State are sound at bottom:
</p>
<p align=""center"">
  HARRISBURGH MONDAY, FEB. 24

</p>
<p>
  On Saturday last, both Houses met at 9 o’clock, &amp; the Farewell Address of
  WASHINGTON was read, after which they immediately adjourned. To-day, in the
  House, 1000 copies of the Address were ordered to be printed for distribution.
</p>
"		The legislature of Pennsylvania apparently made the publication of Washington's Farewell Address an annual event. While I was unable to procure the 1834 edition, I have included the title page from 1837, that indicates the same date (Washington's birthday, February 22) and the resolve of the elected officials to publish it. Just as the publication of Dymond meant that the students at the Canterbury Female Academy were gaining access to high-level current philosophy, the emphasis on the speeches of Clay and Washington indicate that, like any students in an advanced academy of that time, they were exposed to sophisticated examples of public speaking and political rhetoric.

Death of Reuben Fenner	<em>The Unionist</em>	Allied Reform Movements - Temperance	"<p>
  DIED.—At Voluntown, suddenly, Mr Reuben Fenner, aged about 60 years. The
  circumstances attending his departure were lamentably horrid. On the evening
  of Sunday the 23d ult. being at the Tavern in company with one of his comrades
  the latter purchased a quart of
  <em>Cider Brandy</em>
  and they proceeded homeward together, occasionally sipping a little of the
  <em>“good creatures”</em>
  to drown their cares and exhilarate their drooping spirits. Arrived within
  sixty rods of the House to which they were going regaled themselves from the
  bottle till its contents were exhausted &amp; their cares being sufficiently
  drowned, the subject of this notice was there left by his friend to take care
  of himself, where on the following morning he was found dead
  <em>“lying partly on his face,”</em>
  having died without a struggle, and presenting a striking example of the
  careless and easy man(ner) in which the votaries of intemperance are
  translated from one world to another!! A jury of inquest, after due
  examination and enquiry, pronounced the following verdict that,
  <em>
    “The deceased came to his death by an intemperate use of ardent spirits.”
  </em>
  This catastrophe and others of a like kind, which seem to be multiplying
  around us, manifest in a strong light the righteous indignation of Heaven at
  the vices of this age, and present to the maker, the vender and the drinker of
  distilled spirits, a subject for solemn and serious reflection. Let the
  distiller remember that he is opening a fountain, the streams from which will
  render barren the most fruitful field, and sweep away much that is valuable
  and lovely from the earth. Let the vender reflect that, for a paltry
  consideration, he is sporting with the lives and future well being of his
  fellow men, and is calling down upon his own head the unmitigated wrath of
  Jehovah for thus “
  <em>hollding</em>
  [sic]
  <em>the cup to his neighbor’s mouth.</em>
  ” And let the drinker of distilled spirits, if yet the power of resistance is
  not broken down, beware of the suicidal cup: let him flee to the ark of
  <em>total abstinence</em>
  where there alone is safety, ere he is fast bound by the chains which the
  subtle enemy of his peace has forged for him, let him escape as for his life,
  let him made good his retreat while he can and resolve in the majesty of his
  strength, the grace of God enabling him, to act in accordance with that
  resolution, that he will
  <em>“touch not, taste not, handle not the unclean thing.”</em>
  Whosoever will be free, let him be free indeed.

  “The Lousisvile [sic] Bank, a Noble example.—Our opinions as to the duty of
  the banks, designated as the depositories of the public funds, are known to
  the community. The Bank of Louisville, which was selected some months ago as
  an agent of the treasury, has, we rejoice to announce, taken the course
  prescribed by wisdom and justice. Her board of directors, we are authorized to
  say, have adopted resolutions revoking their contract with the government, and
  the Secretary of the Treasury that the revenue already paid into the
  institution under their charge is subject to the Treasurer’s order. Like the
  directors of the Bank of Charleston and of the Bank of Virginia; they have had
  the moral courage to do justice to themselves worthy of the exalted estimation
  in which they are held by an intelligent public.”

"		Kentucky's formal banking system was still in its infancy when the Jacksonian Banking crisis, and the great financial disaster of 1837 happened.

  A letter from Louisville, Kentucky, received in this city, yesterday, states
  that on the day it was written, Committee of Directors of the Louisville Bank,
  which has hitherto been a depository of the Government funds, called at the
  Branch Bank and laid upon the counter about $100,000 of specie and notes
  belonging to the Government. They accompanied this movement by an explanation
  that their Bank had resolved to touch no more the Treasury Funds—that the sum
  brought was all they then held—and from that time their connection with the
  Government must cease.
</p>
<p>
  They remarked also, that they should leave the money in the branch, hoping
  they would consent to take care of it, for that upon no consideration would
  they permit it to return to their vaults. So much for the glorious experiment.

<p align=""center"">State vs. Frederic Olney</p>
<p>
  The information charged the defendant with having on the 28
  <sup>th</sup>
  of January last, feloniously, voluntarily, maliciously, and wilfully, set fire
  to the dwelling-house of Miss Prudence Crandall, in Canterbury, in the County
  of Windham, and then and there, with force and arms, burning the same. The
  information having been read, the defendant for plea, said that he was NOT
  GUILTY.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Ebenezer Sangar</em>
  was at the house of Miss Crandall the day of the fire—did not get there till
  it was pretty much over. The house was wet, and people were at work about it,
  cutting up the floors, &amp;c. While witness was in the house, Mr. Olney (the
  defendant) came in and told Capt. Bacon, who was cutting up the mop-board,
  that it was useless to cut longer for there was no fire. People soon began to
  go away. Mr. Olney showed where he said the fire commenced—placed his hand on
  a particular place and the expressed he used was
  <em>""Gentlemen of the jury, here the fire commenced.”</em>
  He had an iron-bar in his hand, with which he took off the moulding &amp;c.,
  to show what the fire had done. It seemed that the fire had worked from the
  inside of the house to the outside—this appeared by the boards and timbers—the
  top of the soil was burnt off, as was also the outside—it was rotten so that
  it might be picked to pieces—the bottom of the sill was not burnt. In the
  north-east room, below, there was in the inside under the mop-board a crack
  which was perhaps three-eights [sic] of an inch in width—the fire-place is on
  the west side of the room—the house fronts the east—the fire was in the
  north-east corner of the room. There was no difficulty, in the opinion of the
  witness, in setting the house on fire in the way it was from the inside—it
  might have been done by thrusting under-lighted paper, &amp;c. If fired in
  this way the outer edge of the sill would be likely to catch first. Should not
  think that fire could have been put on the outside so as to cause the
  fire—does not think it possible that the top of the sill could have been set
  fire to from the outside, as this sill was. The principal part of the burning
  was high up near the chamber floor.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Cross-examined.</em>
  Saw no fire after he got there. Most of the cutting was done before he got
  there—the weather-board was taken up and the mouldings—some clap-boards had
  been taken off before—it was from 12 to 15 inches from the upright post, and
  south of it, in the corner of the room where the fire did most damage. No hole
  was burned, but the wood was blacked—should think the fire originally
  commenced at the place mentioned near the post. The board next the sill, and
  the side of it next the sill, was burned most—this board had a crack in it,
  and the wood near the crack was charred, mostly on the inside. The lathing was
  burned some, enough so as to black one’s fingers—witness did not make his
  examinations all at one time, but at several—once with Dr. Harris.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Vine Robinson.</em>
  On Saturday of the week that the fire happened he went, as one of the
  committee from the Insurance Company, to make some agreement, if possible,
  with Miss Crandall as to the amount of loss which she had sustained. The house
  seemed to be in the same situation as it was left immediately after the
  fire—the clap-boards were torn off, &amp;c. Examined, to satisfy his mind, how
  the fire originated—became convinced that it took first on the sill, between
  the first stud and the post—burned apparently up to the chamber-floor, and
  meeting with some obstruction there, seemed to branch off—burned the boards
  and joist, should think there was more burning in the chamber-floor than
  elsewhere—proceeded to place the boards, &amp;c. round the pilaster as they
  originally were, in order to ascertain if there was any place where the fire
  could have been introduced from without—the board at the bottom of the sill
  was burnet off—the clap-boards were not burnt—found no place on examination
  where the fire could have been introduced—thinks it impossible to have
  communicated the fire from the outside so as to produce the effect visible—the
  crack between the mop-board and the floor on the inside of the room was
  perhaps one third of an inch wide—no difficulty in putting fire under it—if a
  match were placed under the mop-board and pushed along it would fall about two
  inches on to the sill—witness became satisfied that the Company would be
  responsible for the loss, and tried to settle the amount but could not. It was
  left to Col. Eaton to procure a carpenter and finish the business—the sill was
  considerably decayed—the fire was confined between the first stud and the
  post.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Cross examined.</em>
  There was a hole burnt in the boards a considerable height from the ground,
  higher than he could reach—this could be seen from the outside—the board at
  the bottom was perhaps 8 inches wide—three or four inches of it were burnt
  off—this board was near the post—about the space of a foot along the sill it
  was charred—the sill at the bottom was whole.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Ebenezer Sangar,</em>
  again called, testified as to one of the boards that was burnt near the
  post—the board went to the bottom of the sill.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Elkanah C. Eaton</em>
  was also one of the Committee with Judge Robinson to settle damages, and with
  him examined to find out the origin of the fire. (Col. Eaton said he concurred
  in the statement given by Judge Robinson, and recapitulated, with little
  variation, the same general facts.)
</p>
<p>
  <em>Richard Fenner</em>
  got to the fire nearly as soon as any one—saw the smoke from the outside, and
  went directly into the house. Saw Miss Crandall and asked her if the fire came
  from the cellar; she said, no, her house had been set on fire. Witness
  assisted to pry up the hearth to find the fire, but found but little—the smoke
  continued to increase—water was thrown on. After the fire was got under, Olney
  showed the witness and others a spot on the outside of the house, where he said
  the fire began—witness examined it more critically, because he did not notice
  it when he first came to the fire; Witness came out of his store immediately
  after he heard the bell ring, and a cry of fire—Saw smoke come from the corner
  of the house, up some height from the ground.—Olney said that when he first
  came out of the house, he saw fire blazing out of a crack, and pointed it out
  to witness—the paint around it was scorched.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Cross Examined.</em>
  The crack which Olney showed witness was perhaps an eighth of an inch in width,
  just by the bottom of the sill, between the bottom board and the moulding—saw
  no appearance of fire when the place was pointed out—witness at first saw no
  fire, nothing but smoke which came from about the window casings—Olney was at
  the corner of the house when he got there and had an axe in his hand—it was
  after the fire was over that Olney pointed out this place—perhaps
  three-fourths of an hour after the alarm.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Daniel Morgan</em>
  was at the house of Dr. Harris at the time of the fire, and noticed a tub of
  water brought out from Miss Crandall’s and thrown on to the side of the
  house—a little steam arose which led him to suppose the water was hot—Charles
  Harris soon brought an axe—Olney took it and struck a blow or two on the house
  near the corner with it. Witness then went over to Miss C’s house, but saw no
  fire—looked into the house and saw smoke in the room—told Miss C. that it must
  come from the cellar—examined, but found none—a little smoke could not be seen
  coming out from the house, seven or eight feet from the ground, near the
  floor—they had axes and struck in to take off the clapboards—took off some but
  saw no fire till the floor was torn up in the chamber—then saw a little and a
  great deal of smoke, so much that it was impossible to stay in the room. The
  sill appeared natural, but some rotten—took out some shavings which were black
  but not burnt—witness got to the house before any one, unless it was Mr.
  Robinson—as he could see no fire he was surprised that they had raised an
  alarm—did not see Olney when he first got over to the house—when he first saw
  him he was near the corner of the house—the clapboards which he and Mr
  Robinson cut were as high as they could reach.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Cross Examined.</em>
  Witness saw Olney and Harris at the corner of Miss Crandall’s house, before he
  came over from Dr Harris’—Harris soon started to ring the bell and Olney
  dashed on a tub of water—this was before the blows with an axe—the water was
  thrown on the side of the house, between the window and the post—cannot say
  whether Olney cut off any portion of the house—thought that a small piece was
  cut off at first—continued to think so till the former trial, when a piece was
  shown, said to be cut off—he then and now doubts whether any was cut off—Dr.
  Harris’ house is six or seven rods from Miss Crandall’s.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Ralph Robinson</em>
  got to the fire, when some of the neighbors were standing at the corner—could
  see smoke coming out—witness tried to cut off some of the clapboards, but
  could not reach them—pried them off with an iron bar—they could then see a
  little fire—no clapboards had been cut when witness got there—did not leave
  his school house till after the bell rung—saw no fire at the bottom of the
  pilaster—the clap-boards were got off in a very few minutes, perhaps three—saw
  water thrown on after the clap-boards were taken off, not before.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Peter Spicer,</em>
  (a carpenter,) examined the house day of the the first court (sic). [Mr.
  Spicer showed the manner in which the boards &amp;c. were burned, and gave it
  as his opinion that the fire communicated from within.]
</p>
<p>
  <em>Horace Bacon,</em>
  assisted to arrest Frederick Olney, it was in a barber’s shop at Norwich—a
  number of persons were present—some one asked witness his opinion as to the
  origin of the fire—said that he believed it caught from the inside. Olney said
  he knew as much about the fire as any one. Witness replied, I suppose you do.
  Olney then said that Miss Crandall wished him to fix her clock—that he
  commenced fixing it and soon found smoke in the room—at first thought the
  evergreens in the room were on fire, examined them and found they were
  not—then thought the carpet was—found that it was not. Soon heard the fire
  roar in the walls of the house ran out and saw it burst out from a crack near
  the corner of the house.
</p>
<p>
  <em>James Cary</em>
  read the warrant to Olney in Norwich. Mr Bacon said that he thought the fire
  caught on the inside—Olney said that there was a knot-hole outside about the
  bigness of a dollar where the fire might have been placed. (Witness then went
  out).
</p>
<p>
  <em>Maria Robinson</em>
  was at Miss Crandall’s house at work on the 28
  <sup>th</sup>
  day of January, the day of the fire—the stage stopped, and the first she saw
  Olney he was standing by the side of the stage—some bundles &amp;c. were
  brought into the house and Olney came in and sat down in the keeping-room by
  the fire, remarked that it was cold, looking at the clock on the mantel-piece,
  after he had sat a few moments, said to Miss Crandall, “your clock does not
  beat right.” Miss Crandall replied, that she had not noticed it, or did not
  know it. Miss Crandall soon asked him to take off his surtout, and said that
  she had not asked him before because she supposed he was cold—Mr Olney asked
  if Mr. and Mrs Harris were in the house, and was told they were in the
  kitchen, said to Miss Crandall, “with your permission I will go and see them,”
  she said, yes—he came back in a little while, and that he had promised to
  write to a lady in New-York as soon as he got there and had seen her little
  daughter, the paper was brought, and Olney wrote and sealed a letter, he then
  went out and witness saw him no more till dinner, when she saw him in the
  upper kitchen, talking with Mr. and Mrs. Harris. After dinner she came back to
  the keeping-room, and a number of the girls were in and out. They all went out
  but witness, as she thinks, (she remarked that Miss Almira Crandall thought
  she remained after her) and witness, who was sewing, laid down her work, and
  went to the kitchen. Had heard Olney talking in the kitchen before this, and
  had seen him there. Very soon there was a disturbance, and some one cried that
  the house was on fire. Witness said it could not be, but ran up stairs, for
  she remembered that she had left her work on the hearth and she was afraid
  that it had caught fire. Found the room so full of smoke, when she got to it,
  that she could not see the figure on the paper. Ran out of doors, and saw
  Olney standing near the corner of the house, looking for the fire. Witness
  told him that the chimney or roof was on fire, he said no, and soon said he
  had found it. Olney then struck on the corner of the house, with an axe, and
  told her to cry fire. It was about half-past ten or eleven when Olney came in
  the stage, witness noticed no smoke nor perceived any unpleasant smell in the
  keeping-room before fire was cried, don’t know where Olney went when he went
  from the keeping-room, but supposed he went to the kitchen.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Cross examined.</em>
  Was in the keeping-room when the stage came up—soon after Olney came in the
  clock struck eleven—thinks it was an hour after dinner when she was employed
  sewing—Olney had not been alone in the keeping-room more than a minute,
  when the fire was cried—after Olney had struck on the corner of the house with
  the axe, he called for water—he had asked for an axe before—he cut off a small
  piece of the house, and some one bro’t water—told Harris to get the bell
  rung—heard nothing said about fixing the clock—there were festoons of
  evergreen hung around the room.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Amy Fenner</em>
  was in the school room at the time of the fire—saw Mr. Olney as he came in the
  stage, at about half past ten—saw him no more till dinner. Witness went
  upstairs to the school room, and Miss Crandall sent the class down to
  read—they came down to the keeping-room, and witness saw Mr. Olney fixing the
  clock—she saw smoke, and said to Mr. Olney, What is the matter? What does this
  mean? She pointed Olney to the corner of the room—he put down his ear, and
  said he heard it roar—then immediately called for an axe—witness was very much
  scared.
  <strong>Editorial note: this is the key testimony, from a student</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Cross examined.</em>
  Knows nothing of the letter—Olney was talking with Mrs. Harris when witness
  saw him at dinner—‘twas not more than three minutes after she was told to go
  down with the class to read before she was in the room with Olney—he was
  alone—the door was wide open—cannot tell what Olney was doing to the clock,
  she was so frightened—smelled nothing in the room before—Olney’s back was
  towards the smoke, he could not see it without turning round—witness could see
  it immediately on entering—heard no walking in the room before she came in,
  was out of doors when the tub of water was thrown on the house—Olney took the
  tub from the hands of Miss Crandall—cannot tell whether the door of the clock
  was open or not she was so frightened—the smoke had just began to come out of
  the corner.

<p>
  <em>Henrietta Bolt</em>
  was a member of the same class, and made a statement similar to the last
  witness.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Delano Baker</em>
  was at the fire not long after it was cried—went from Dr. Harris’ wood-pile,
  saw smoke, but no fire was visible—Olney was standing by the corner of the
  house, axes were called for, witness said he could get one. After the fire was
  over Olney showed where he said the fire began—said, “here, gentlemen of the
  jury, here is the place where the fire began.” Witness went away soon, and did
  not notice where Olney directed their attention—saw no fire at the former,
  when he got to the house first; thinks he should have seen it if there had
  been any; a spot was burned up some distance from the ground.
</p>

  <em>Ralph Hutchinson</em>
  examined the house of Miss Crandall on the day of the court of inquiry before
  the Justice; the board on the outside, near the crack, was burnt to a coal; a
  part of the burning could be seen from the outside; did not notice whether the
  lath was burnt or not; the pedestal is 16 3-4 inches; the base of the pilaster
  1 1-4 feet; the mop-board was up from the floor a full half inch, a foot from
  the corner; the first stud was perhaps 13 inches from the post; thinks the
  fire could easily have been introduced from the inside; the mortar was gone at
  the time of the examination made by witness, and that being gone, the fire
  could also have been introduced from the outside; if the mortar had not been
  taken out, he should think it could not have been introduced from the outside;
  witness saw mortar lying on the ground.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Cross examined.</em>
  The place where the burnt part could be seen from without, was by the
  water-stable; it was just perceivable; should think the fire might have been
  seen at this place from without; the bottom board sets on the water-table; the
  inside of the oak board was burnt very much; the outside not much; the fire
  could not have been put on the top of the sill from the outside.

  <em>Chauncey Bacon,</em>
  at the time that Miss Crandall’s house was discovered to be on fire, was in
  Mr. Jenk’s store. At first, he heard the bell ring, and saw people running,
  apparently towards Miss C.’s house. When he got to her front gate, he asked
  what was the matter? Was told, by a boy, that the house was on fire, and was
  pointed towards the northeast corner of the house; went directly into the
  house and found considerable smoke; some one took an axe, and beat a hole from
  the inside, through the plaster, in the east wall of the room; being told, on
  enquiry, that there was no other axe, witness got one from home and beat a
  number of holes in the north wall of the room; found no fire, and but little
  or no smoke; others were turning in water; witness then went into the cellar
  to look for the fire, but found none; then to the garret, and found none; soon
  after, witness went out of doors and found the people tearing off boards,
  &amp;c.; some were cutting up the boards in the floor up stairs, and he
  assisted; smoke came out and they threw in water; came down stairs, and saw
  fire first near the cornice, in the room below; could see but a small blaze;
  ran up stairs and told the people that the floor must come up; they took it
  up, together with the mop-board and very soon came to the fire; six or eight
  feet of the mop-board was cut off; the fire was soon got under; witness then
  examined the timbers, &amp;c. more particularly, though he could not do so as
  he wished, there was such a crowd; the lining boards were oak, put on the
  studs, and ran clear by, to the cut-edge of the post; the bottom board, south
  of where it was burnt off, was very snug, so that he could not pass a penknife
  in the crack; the crack between the mop-board and the floor, in the lower
  room, was large enough to take in his little finger, in some places; the under
  floor boards set on the sill about four inches; the upper ones an inch less;
  should not think it possible to get fire on the sill from the outside.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Cross examined.</em>
  He put his finger in the crack, between the floor and the mop-board; the
  widest part of it was towards the south, at some distance from the corner,
  perhaps six feet; the floor boards run north and south; put his finger in the
  crack the day after the fire, and has since examined it; should think that the
  crack was 1-4 on an inch, near the corner; perceived no difference in its
  width at the different times he examined it; don’t know whether the sill was
  burnt at the bottom or on the sides; should think the under lining board was
  wider than the sill; the end of the bottom board was nurnt off; the board
  above it extends along to the end, so he presumes this one did; cannot say
  whether the board burnt off was fastened to the sill or not; has not examined
  the sill south of the stud where te fire was; found shavings between the studs
  after taking off the plastering; but few, perhaps three, four, or half a
  dozen. They were further south than where the fire was, between the first stud
  and post; don't recollect whether burnt or not; they were small pieces, not
  bigger than ninepenny pieces or cents; were old, and had probably been there
  from the building of the house.

  <em>John Bard.</em>
  (This witness was present during the fire, and assisted to extinguish it; he
  gave particulars of the transaction, but stated no new facts that seemed
  material.)
</p>
<p>
  <em>Solomon Paine,</em>
  with the committee from the Insurance Company, examined the premises after the
  fire. (Mr. Paine said he coincided in the statement made by Col. Eaton as to
  what they saw.) His opinion was, that if the lining board was as wide at the
  place where the fire was, as it was farther back, it would be impossible to
  set the fire from the outside; the board was some inches higher than the sill,
  a little back from the fire, where it was not burnt.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Nehemiah Ensworth.</em>
  After he got to the fire, to which he was called by the ringing of the bell,
  he first went to the corner of the house and soon went into the house, met
  Olney and asked how the fire caught. Olney replied that he did not know, said
  he saw it about as soon as any one, that he was fixing the clock, saw a smoke,
  examined, and soon heard the fire roar, witness at this time did not know
  Olney.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Daniel Morgan</em>
  again called. Saw the mortar taken out from the outside after the fire; it was
  whole.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Cross examined.</em>
  Did not state this fact before the other court, though he did to some one
  present, perhaps Capt. Fenner, several persons took out some of the mortar,
  witness took out some, an inch and a half long, took it out to examine the
  sill, has not examined else-where, what he took out was moist, took it out
  with his fingers, some had been taken out before, cannot be positive who took
  it out; it was after the fire had been extinguished; Mr. Flint was present;
  thinks he took out some; it was under the sill and ran perpendicular; the
  mortar which he (the witness) took out was between the stones, immediately
  below the sill, not more than two or three inches below.
</p>
<p>
  <em>William Worthington.</em>
  After the fire was pretty much out, Olney went up stairs and put his arm round
  one of the girl’s neck, and asked how many of them cried? They said, such a
  one. Olney then said they had no need to be scared before they were hurt; that
  he did not think the house would burn down, if it had, Miss Crandall would
  lose nothing for the house was insured; witness got to the house before the
  fire broke out; could then see no fire; went close to the corner; saw smoke;
  did not see Olney for a few minutes; no clapboards were cut when he (the
  witness) first got there. Mr. Robinson cut the first as high as he could
  reach.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Cross examined.</em>
  Don’t know how many girls were present at the time of conversation he speaks
  of, shouldn’t know them now; witness was a pupil in Mr. Robinson’s school; he
  was in school, and it was said that Miss Crandall’s house was on fire; Mr. R.
  got there about as soon as they did; don’t know whether Mr Morgan was then
  there or not; saw him soon; did not see Miss Crandall; saw no water when he
  first got there; looked round to find the fire, and then went into the house;
  they had cut a few holes in the plastering; saw Olney near the corner of the
  house first.

that has gone abroad, induced by an article in our paper of week before last, in
which we alluded to his nomination for Senator. A meaning was attached to our
remarks by some, which we never intended should be and never thought would be
attached to them—namely, that because Mr. Pearl is a farmer, and not a
professional man, he is therefore unqualified for the office to which he is
nominated. Nothing could be farther from our intention than to convey such an
idea. Till within a few years we were ourself a farmer, and from a more intimate
acquaintance with that class of working-men than with any other, we take the
most lively interest in every thing calculated to promote their political or
moral welfare. We are not opposed to Mr. Pearl because he is not a professional
man, but because we believe him opposed to some of those eternal principles of
right which are to us dear as the apple of our eye, and which we feel ourself
solemnly pledged to defend according to the best of our feeble abilities. For
Mr. Pearl’s private character we entertain the most unfeigned respect—but while
we believe him pursuing a political course which we consider detrimental to our
dearest interests as a people, we must, if we would be honest, most strenuously
oppose his political elevation.”

Commentary on Acquittal of Frederick Olney	<em>The Unionist</em>	Canterbury Female Academy; African-American Students; Education; Race; Vigilante Violence; Prudence Crandall	"<p>
  <em>The Fire at Canterbury—</em>
  Mr. Frederick Olney has had his trial on the charge of having set fire to Miss
  Crandall’s house; and he has been fully acquitted. We trust, not the slightest
  suspicion of his guilt remains on the mind of any disinterested persons, who
  heard the trial. The jury would probably have given their verdict without
  leaving their seats, if they had previously chosen a foreman. But so soon as
  they had retired to their room and organized, they gave a unanimous vote in
  his favor. And this they might have done if they had heard only the evidence
  on the part of the State—for the testimony of some of the witnesses brought
  forward by the public prosecutor, went to show clearly that even if the fire
  were communicated on the inside, Mr. Olney could not have done it.
</p>
<p>
  Now, therefore, that Col. Judson and his coadjutors have been permitted to
  indulge their suspicions to the utmost, and to subject a perfectly innocent
  man to the mortification and expense of a criminal prosecution, because he
  happened to be on the
  <em>inside</em>
  of Miss Crandall’s house on the day of the fire, now, we seriously hope that he
  and they will look diligently among those on the
  <em>outside</em>
  of the house for the real incendiary. No one, we trust, is willing to suspect
  that the Col. or any of the respectable people in Canterbury, did the deed;
  but there probably are persons in the town capable of such a crime—or some who
  might do it without considering it would be a
  <em>crime</em>
  thus, or in any other way, to “break up” the “nigger school.” Col. Judson and
  his fellow laborers against that school have done all in their power to excite
  the most virulent and reckless hostility to it. We were ourselves present in
  the famous town meeting on the 9
  <sup>th</sup>
  of March, 1833, and there we heard enough said by the Col. and his colleagues
  to instigate persons of a certain character to violence against the school. It
  is notorious that minor acts of violence have repeatedly been committed
  against her house—and they must not wonder if those who have thrown stones and
  rotten eggs and filth, with impunity if not with applause, should be
  emboldened to apply even the slow match. That this or something like this was
  meditated the public are compelled to believe by the article in the Advertiser
  of Dec. 19
  <sup>th*</sup>
  —and will not all have reason to suspect that the Col. and his coadjutors and
  the public prosecutor are leagued to protect the real culprit, unless they now
  set about in earnest to find him, in the direction pointed out by Mr.
  Holbrook? This mysterious affair ought to be cleared up. No one could rejoice
  more than we should do to have it satisfactory proved, that the fire was
  accidental. But there appears to be scarcely any doubt that it was the work of
  an incendiary. Therefore let the felon be hunted for without further delay.
  Mr. Holbrook has refused to give to the public at our request, and has even
  refused to give to Miss Crandall, an explanation of his meaning in the article
  to which we have so often alluded. But Col. Judson and the State’s Attorney
  can doubtless elicit from him the information which has so long been called
  for in vain.

  <em>determination</em>
  has been formed to BREAK UP the

  wish to encourage such a determination. And we seriously hope that our belief
  is not sufficiently authorized.—The best way is to wait patiently and let the
  law take its own course, and to let all doubts as to its constitutionality be
  indulged to their utmost extent. The peaceable and undisturbed manner however,
  in which the Instructress has of late been permitted to go on with her school,
  in violation of a law which the
  <em>people</em>
  of this state have deliberately enacted could hardly have been expected by
  her. And we have no hesitation in saying that but few towns in this or
  <em>any other</em>
  State, would have shown so much forbearance towards such an establishment, as
  have the people of Canterbury. We were not aware until we were so informed by
  our correspondent last week, that the number of the scholars now in attendance
  at the abolition school was so great. We know that great efforts have been
  made by its abettors,
  <em>since the decision</em>
  of Chief Justice Daggett, to fill up the benches of the school house, and to
  increase the grievances and insults of our citizens, but we did not know until

  Bulletin. Uncle Davy Kies seems to think they are
  <em>“All Hearty”</em>
  but you know he don’t reside at Head-Quarters now. The last orders were dated
  at Canterbury a few rods North of Miss Crandall’s school. It was officially
  announced here this morning by one of the recruiting officers, (the
  <em>gentleman</em>
  who ran away from Brooklyn a few years ago with some hundreds of the people’s
  money, and who, in consequence of his clamorous declamations in favor of
  Jackson, is now enjoying a considerable bite of Uncle Sam’s treasury pap,
  against the known wishes of the people,) that Uncle Davy’s Democrats were all
  ready for action. That the misunderstanding and difficulty among the officers
  had blown over and all were as good friends as ever. Col. A.T. the commanding
  officer, is looking out for promotion. Uncle Davy says when all the officers
  of his division get together this Spring at New-Haven, he will have the Col.
  appointed Commissary, Judge, or something which he will like much better than
  actual service in the field, and thus give a better chance for the under
  officers. But the Col. would be altogether out of his place, on the bench. He
  would appear, and no doubt feel, much like Jack Downing’s mouse, treed in an
  empty flour barrel.—The old gentleman has not concluded yet whether to issue
  another Proclamation or not—but he says something must be done to procure more
  soldiers. He don’t seem to like the appearance of the old Republican army, and
  what looks more cloudy than any thing else, he don’t think it will do to come
  into action till he gets a new recruit from Windham. But every good soldier
  listed in the Republican army just as soon as they found out what Uncle
  Davy and the ‘Arch Bishop’ were up to. You might as well undertake to make
  Bull-Frog pond run right over ‘Zion’s Hill’ as to get one of the Republicans

  an effort to free themselves from it? Shall the counsel of their
  Representatives be disregarded with impunity? Shall their petitions for relief
  be wholly rejected and their agents treated with gross indignity by the
  Executive Head of this nation?—There are motives enough and I trust they will
  have their legitimate influence. The first Monday of April which is just at

  who pretends to be a FREEMAN say, that he is no politician and cares not for
  the result of the election. But let each one remember that he owes a duty to
  his country which he is bound to perform. Are you told by some officious

Melancholy Disaster [Wreck of the William Penn]	<em>The Unionist</em>	National News	"<p align=""center""><em>From The U.S. Gazette.</em></p>
<p>
  MELANCHOLY ACCIDENT — Yesterday afternoon, (Wednesday 5
  <sup>th</sup>
  inst.) about 5 o’clock P.M. just as the William Penn, with about 150
  passengers, from Baltimore, had come round the point, below this city,
  (Philadelphia,) she was discovered to be on fire near the furnace. The
  rapidity of her motion creating a strong draft, and the very combustible
  nature of every piece of wood near the fire, soon rendered it certain that the
  boat would be lost. She was accordingly run ashore on the muddy margin of the
  river, before reaching which she seemed to be in one full blaze. Here the
  passengers jumped out; and most of their baggage and part of the great
  Southern Mail were thrown ashore. Many of the passengers jumped overboard. A
  steamboat went down and brought up from the wreck most of the passengers to
  the usual landing place.
</p>
<p>
  We learned late Wednesday evening, that the dead bodies of a gentleman and
  lady were taken from the river.
</p>
<p>
  Several lives were saved by the hazardous exertions of persons belonging to
  the boat, and by those who were drawn to the scene. From the great number of
  passengers, and the confusion consequent on such an awful scene, it was
  impossible to ascertain with any degree of certainty the extent of personal
  injury sustained.
</p>
<p>
  Some of the passengers stripped themselves, jumped into the river and swam
  ashore—they were taken up almost perishing from the cold.
</p>
<p>
  It was mentioned to us that a lady in company with the Rev. Dr. Mitchellmore,
  of Lewistown, Del. jumped into the river in her consternation. Mr. M. followed her
  and was drowned. At our last information hopes were entertained of recovering
  the lady.
</p>
<p>Col. Joseph S. Porter is among the drowned.</p>
<p>One man drifted out into the river on a settee, but was finally saved.</p>
<p>
  When the boat was run ashore, she run with her bows into the mid, and her
  stern in deep water—the fire was raging so intensely in the centre of the
  boat, as to prevent the passengers who were aft, from going forward—they
  therefore jumped into the water beyond their depth.
</p>
<p>
  We regret to add, the lady mentioned above, died between 8 and 9 o’clock. She
  was in a delicate state of health. The body has been removed by the Coroner to
  Cherry Hill, where it will remain for a short time, for recognition.
</p>
<p>
  The fire took in the wood house. The boat was burnt to the water’s edge—the
  loss sustained is about $70,000.
</p>
"		One of the five people who died was described as a prominent Connecticut businessman. Another of the five, Rev.

and its Remedy.” It is an excellent work and worthy a place in the Library of
every searcher for truth in the country.
"		"<p>Amos Phelps (1805-1847) was an endorser of the school. His pamphlet being locally available suggests, once again, that the students at the Canterbury Female Academy were reading about their own struggle!</p><p> <p>
</p>
<p>The pamphlet in question, for instance, compared the Canterbury Female Academy students to impressed sailors (one of the alleged causes of the War of 1812):
  “The war of the revolution was a contest for principle. Had the principle in
  question been yielded, who could have set limits to the acts of oppression
  growing out it ? So also in our war for sailors’ rights, the bone of
  contention was, the right of search and impressment. The mere fact that a few
  seamen had been injured and abused, was as nothing, aside from the principle
  involved. This, in common with that of the revolution, was a contest for
  principle, and the oppression resisted was the oppression of principle. And
  further, whence the utter odiousness and the cruel oppression of the far-famed
  ‘black law’ of Connecticut? Not that Miss Crandall and a few colored Misses
  are subjected by it to certain shameful acts of cruelty and oppression. These
  are as nothing, comparatively, except as they involve principle; and the law,

  THE LADY’S BOOK,
  <em>
    a monthly Magazine, of original and selected Tales, Poetry, Essays, and
    Music, embellished with several hundred engravings, and quarterly plates of
    the Philadelphia Fashions, superbly colored.
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  When, about four years ago, the Lady’s Book was submitted to the test of
  publication; the proprietors made no professions likely to create expectations
  which they could anticipate even an improbability of realizing: they were
  determined nevertheless progressively to adopt every improvement which
  diligent anxiety to please their patrons should suggest; and have now the
  remunerating satisfaction, after having faithfully and steadily pursued their
  course, of seeing it sanctioned by a circulation more extensive than that of
  any other monthly journal in the United States, and as this extent of
  patronage is the most admissible evidence of its past utility, it is offered
  as the best guarantee for its future excellence. The literary department of
  the Lady’s Book is of admitted superiority; for in conjunction with the great
  but boasted liberality with which they encourage the development of
  <em>Native Authors,</em>
  they possess facilities of selection, through their foreign agents and
  correspondents from works of which
  <em>no other copies</em>
  are sent to this country.
</p>
<p>
  Among the many claims which the Lady’s Book has on the patronage of Americans,
  the least is not, that it was the first publication to present correct
  representations of the newest fashions of female costume, and in that respect
  it may fairly claim a superiority over all other contemporaries: for we
  proprietors seldom calculate the expense of rendering it altogether deserving
  of its increased and increasing patrons.
</p>
<p>
  Never was the title of a book more justified by its contents than that of the
  Lady’s Book—Literature, foreign and domestic—selected and original—Engravings
  on steel and wood, of scenery, distinguished persons, fashions and embroidery,
  all rich and beautiful, and from the hands of the most eminent artists. Its
  literature select, free from dullness, though teeming with usefulness, and
  conveying pleasure and amusement through the extensive medium of delicate
  discrimination. To musical amateurs of both sexes, the Lady’s Book offers many
  advantages, each number being accompanied by a popular piece, arranged with
  accompaniments for the piano forte, &amp;c &amp;c. under the
  <em>surveillance</em>
  of competent persons, and to its pages the general reader can always turn and
  find amusement, novelty, and instruction.
</p>
<p>
  Each number shall, as hitherto, average 60 pages of extra royal octavo letter
  press, printed with clear, new and beautiful type, on paper of the finest
  texture and whitest colour. It will continue to be embellished with the most
  splendid engravings on copper and steel, embracing every variety of subject,
  and the quarterly numbers will as heretofore contain figures of Philadelphia
  Fashions, two and occasionally three, beautifully and faithfully colored, to
  commence with the January number, being No. 1 of the eighth volume. It may be
  necessary to say that these engravings are designed, drawn and engraved,
  expressly for this work, by competent persons, specially engaged for that
  purpose.

Advertisement for Parley's Magazine	<em>The Unionist</em>	Advertisement with Education Theme	"<p>CIRCULAR</p>
<p><em>TO PARENTS, TEACHERS, SCHOOL COMMITTEES,</em></p>
<p><em>And all who feel an Interest in the Improvement of Youth.</em></p>
<p>
  It is not yet quite a year since Parley’s Magazine was commenced. During that
  short period the number of subscribers has increased to 20,000, and the work
  has received, every where, the most unqualified approbation. It has found its
  way to thousands of families, and while it has entertained the social circle,
  its unobtrusive lessons have, we trust, often had a <em>salutary influence</em>
  on the <em>juvenile mind</em> and <em>heart.</em>
  It has also found its way to the school room; and many classes of young pupils
  have been cheered twice a month by the welcome voice of their teacher
  bidding them to lay aside for a few days, the class book which they have read
  over and over, perhaps twenty times, and read the pages of Parley’s Magazine.
  The demand for the work, to be used in schools, is rapidly increasing.
</p>
<p>
  Encouraged by such unexampled success, the Publishers have resolved to render
  it still more worthy so liberal a patronage; and not to remit their exertions
  till they see it introduced into families and schools, throughout the whole
  length and breadth of the United States.
</p>
<p>
  In this view they have secured new aid in the Editorial department. The late
  Editor of the Juvenile Rambler, who, in addition to his qualifications as a
  writer for the young, has the advantage of many years experience as a teacher,
  will henceforth assist in conducting it.
</p>
<p>
  We propose to present, in the progress of each volume, a great variety of
  interesting and important topics, among which are the following.
</p>
<p>
  I. Natural History—Of beasts, birds, fishes, reptiles, insects; plants,
  flowers, trees; the human frame, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>II. Biography—Especially of the young.</p>
<p>III. Geography—Accounts of places, manners, customs, etc.</p>
<p>IV. Travels and Voyages, in various parts of the world.</p>
<p>
  V. Lively Descriptions of the Curiosities of <em>Nature</em> and <em>Art—</em> in each of the United States, and in other countries.
</p>
<p>
  VI. Lessons on Objects that daily surround Children in the Parlor, Nursery,
  Garden, etc. Accounts of Trades and Employments.
</p>
<p>
  VII. Particular Duties of the Young—to Parents, Teachers, Brothers, Sisters,
  etc.
</p>
<p>VIII. Bible Lessons and Stories</p>
<p>IX. Narratives—Such as are well authenticated—Original Tales</p>
<p>
  X. Parables, Fables, and Proverbs, where the moral is obvious and excellent.
</p>
<p>XI. Poetry—Adapted to the Youthful capacity and feelings.</p>
<p>
  XII.I ntelligence—Embracing Accounts of Juvenile <em>Books</em>, Societies, and <em>Remarkable Occurrences.</em>
</p>
<p>
  Many of these subjects will be illustrated by numerous and beautiful
  engravings, prepared by the best artists , and selected not only with a view
  to <em>adorn</em> the work, but to improve the taste, cultivate the mind, and raise the
  affections of the young to appropriate and worthy objects. We would make them
  better brothers, better sisters, better pupils, better associates, and, in the
  end, better citizens.
</p>
<p>
  We beg the friends of education—especially parents and teachers, to view the
  matter in this fight. Let children look upon the pictures, not as pictures <em>merely;</em>
  but let them be taught to <em>study</em> them. What can be more rich in valuable materials for instructive lessons than
  a good engraving?
</p>
<p>
  After this brief explanation of our principles and purposes, we ask the
  co-operation of all who receive this Circular. Will you aid us, by your
  influence, in this great work—the formation of mind and character for the
  rising generation? Will you assist us all in your power, in our endeavors to
  introduce to American schools, and parlors, and firesides, the stories and
  lessons of Parley’s Magazine?
</p>
<p>
  Every single number of the new volume will have a strong paper cover,
  abundantly sufficient to preserve the work in good order for binding and for
  use in schools.
</p>
<p>
  The yearly subscription being but one <em>dollar</em>, our friends will perceive the impracticability of keeping open so many
  thousand accounts. It is therefore indispensable that we should require
  payment always in advance.
</p>
<p>
  Two numbers more will close the first year, and we now give this notice that
  all who desire to continue the Magazine, may signify their intention by a
  seasonable advance for the second year.
</p>
<p>
  In any of the subscribers should not receive all their numbers, they can
  request the Post-Master to notify us of such as are missing, and they shall be
  sent again free of charge.

<p>
  Dear Sir:—Among my political engagements, I have always found some leisure
  moments left me for literary amusement. The employment of the School Master,
  once so useful and dear to me, does now, at times, call me back to the
  examination of letters, syllables, words, spellings and readings. Perhaps I
  mingle with all these some political considerations; for I confess, that my
  anxiety for the preservation and perpetuation of our Union and National
  Government, is so great, that I often ardently wish all the children in the
  United States could be taught to read from the same set of books. Not because
  this might give a uniformity of pronunciation throughout the country, so
  desirable to Poets and Orators; but more than this, because the same juvenile
  literature studied and read, in the same language, would go far to give to
  each succeeding generation not only the same knowledge, but something like a
  brotherhood of feelings, sentiments, and opinions, than could, in any other
  way be obtained. I know you as a citizen, feel a deep interest in all this;
  and because you, as one of the highly useful and laborious fraternity of
  Printers and venders of books, may have a peculiar interest in some of those
  put forth for the instruction of children, I shall, at this time, press on
  your attention this subject in connexion with the best which I have yet seen.
</p>
<p>
  Our worthy fellow-citizen, Mr. Oliver Angell, seems to have had purposes much
  akin to my wishes, when he composed and published his system of classics for
  children. He had named his books the “Union;” and if you look quite through
  them, you will find nothing in the whole, for the reading of children, but
  that spirit and those principles which alone can preserve the Union, the
  purest morals, piety and patriotism. There is, also, a progression in the
  readings found in these books, admirably contrived to go along with that of
  the human mind in its growth from childhood up to perfect maturity.
</p>
<p>
  In mere orthography, the alphabet, the vowels, consonants, dipthongs,
  syllables, spellings, perhaps Mr. Angell might have done better for the
  <em>Instructor</em>
  who may use his books; but after all, it will be found doubtful if any one can
  do better for the
  <em>Pupil</em>
  for whom this good man seems alone to have been solicitous. The Instructor
  should carry in his head, the correct pronunciation of every word in our
  spoken language, and a key for all the various sounds of every letter in all
  its various combinations whenever he looks at that language as it is printed
  or written.
</p>
<p>
  We have more vowels in our spoken than in our printed or written language; and
  those who compose spelling books have supplied the deficiency by figures added
  to the printed character of each vowel. These Algebraic vowels, half letter,
  half figure, used in spelling books, are not printed in books of any other
  kind; so that a child, though he may have learned the different sounds of the
  printed vowels and can pronounce them when he spells; yet when he comes to
  read in other books, where one half of each vowel is omitted and it becomes
  thereby a new letter, he knows not how to pronounce it; and he must, at last,
  learn its different sounds in the different combinations of each with other
  letters. This would have been easier done, at first, when he was spelling,
  than, at last, when he is reading. Last or first, he must learn them, from the
  Instructor, or from the dictionary; and the Algebraic vowels, called the key,
  while useful to the Instructors themselves not well instructed, may be
  detrimental to the pupil. On the whole, I have seen no system of School Books
  equal, or any where near equal to Mr. Angell’s Union; and I think if they
  could be universally used in our English Schools in the whole country, our
  children would become not only better scholars, but better patriots, not less
  citizens of Rhode-Island, or South-Carolina and more citizens of the United
  States.
</p>
<p>I am dear Sir, very truly, your obedient servant.</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  TRISTAM BURGES.
</p>
<p>
  <em>From the Preceptors of the Public Schools in the City of Providence</em>
</p>
<p>
  We have used Mr. Angell’s series of school books, for nearly one year; and
  from this long trial we can say with confidence that we believe them admirably
  suited to answer the purposes for which they were composed. From our
  examination of the inferior numbers, which are used in the primary Schools, we
  believe them also to be no less useful. As reading books, they all combine in
  our opinion, many peculiar excellencies. The first, which will strike all who
  use them, is their perfect
  <em>adaptation</em>
  to the
  <em>capacities</em>
  of those for whom they were designed. This, we consider a most important
  advantage in an elementary book, and one which has not been heretofore
  sufficiently attended to.
</p>
<p>
  The books put into the hands of children at school have generally been
  altogether
  <em>above the understanding</em>
  of the young mind; and the consequence has been, that the scholars have noy
  only made much less progress in a given time, but have acquired the lasting
  <em>disgust</em>
  for their studies which has operated as an effectual bar to future
  improvement. To this great and extensive evil, Mr. Angell’s books afford a
  <em>certain and easy remedy.</em>
  The facility with which his lessons are
  <em>understood</em>
  added to their very interesting nature, causes them to be read by the scholar
  with eagerness and delight; by which means his love of study and his
  improvement in learning are both successfully promoted. The introduction of
  spelling lessons, in connection with reading lessons, into all the books, is
  an advantage which they possess over those previously in use. This
  arrangement, by enabling the pupil to become acquainted with each separate
  word, immediately before he is called to read them, is well calculated to
  render that exercise correct and pleasing, at the same time that it renders
  orthography a less dry and uninteresting study than the usual mode. It also
  considerably promotes economy by rendering the purchase of a separate spelling
  book unnecessary. The
  <em>appending of questions</em>
  to each reading lesson we consider a very valuable improvement, since, by
  calling the attention of the pupil more closely to the subject, it will lead
  him to a better understanding of what is read. The natural gradation from what
  is easy, to what is more difficult, which is observed throughout this whole
  series, is a circumstance that renders them peculiarly valuable. Entertaining
  these opinions, we cheerfully recommend them to the attention of teachers and
  others interested in the cause of education; confident, that to all who are
  aware how much success in teaching depends upon proper books, they will be
  peculiarly acceptable. P.W. FERRIS, E.W. BAKER, ESEK ALDRICH, SILAS WESTON,

  I most cheerfully recommend them to the serious and immediate attention of my

<p>
  From an impression, received and corroborated by a long continued course of
  instruction, in regard to the best methods of communicating knowledge to the
  youthful mind, I am free to confess that the Spelling and reading Books, of
  which Mr. Oliver Angell is the author, are not excelled, in their adaption to
  the purposes for which they are intended by any other books with which I am
  acquainted. Their prominent characteristic is simplicity; and when the public
  mind has taken the stand, to which it seems rapidly advancing, that children
  and youth must understand what they read and what they learn, then at least
  the works of Mr. Angell will receive that patronage, which they so eminently
  deserve. This testimony in favor of that gentleman is designed not as a mere
  puff; but as a just tribute of praise to one who has labored long and
  faithfully for the public good. ROSWELL C. SMITH.

The eye, heart, and hand of christian faith looks, prays, and acts for its completion. </p> <p> But another reformation is needed in the church. It must be as separate from slavery, as from intemperance. The nation groans under the burden and misery and guilt of both these sins. It is the solemn duty of the church to clear itself from both these tremendous crimes. This is not addressed to the world, for the world legalizes the traffic in rum, and in the bodies and souls of men. But it is addressed to the children of God, who, if they know and do their duty, can have no possible connection with either of these trades. If increasing light has shown that christians ought not to buy and sell ardent spirits, much more it is believed, will increasing light show that christians ought not to buy human beings. </p> <p> The Rev John Newton, even after he became pious, transported Africans in chains across the Atlantic, to be sold with their posterity into slavery. Could he have been a true christian, and have no upbraidings of conscience while so engaged? Yes. How is it possible? It was legal, and, at that time, honorable, and his mind was not enlightened.—Afterwards when it was he lamented his error. So there are in our country those who buy and sell their fellow beings, who, if their minds were enlightened, would lament and relinquish it. </p> <p> A few years ago, a man, whose whole daily earnings were required by his family, set up forty nights to run a distillery for forty dollars, which he gave to build a house of worship.—How could he think that money obtained by changing the bread of the poor, into the liquid fire of death, acceptable to God? Because his mind was in darkness. Would he do it now? No. Neither would the church now receive it. Why? Because the light of the temperance reformation has burst forth. </p> <p> Christians! who have promised supreme obedience to Him, that tasted death for every man, and more for the rich man, who, in a superb dress, rides in a superb carriage, to a superb church, to worship in superb style, than for the poor African, who pulls cotton in the “fields of Alabama, and naked as in the hour of birth, trembles under the blasts of mid winter”—on you is this call for a reformation in the church of that God, who declares himself no respector [sic] of persons.—Why do you exclude the dealer in ardent spirits from the communion table, and invite to it the dealer in human flesh? This could not, would not be, if there had been half so much effort made to show the utter abominations of christian slavery, as there has been to show the abominations of christian drunkenness. Whatever maybe the event of slavery and intemperance in the world a sufficiency of light will show, and cause to be removed these shocking deformities of the christian church. One denomination has already raised thousands of dollars to assist their brethren in becoming free from the deep stains of this awful sin. When will other denominations be equally sincere and active to cleanse themselves from this pollution? The answer is plain. When they are as conscientious and as much enlightened. </p> <p> To have light poured on this subject as its importance demands, it is proposed to raise fifty dollars, as a premium for the best essay on this deeply interesting subject. When the church is pure, we may then expect the smiles and approbation of heaven on our now almost divided land. And oh! May none refuse their mite to reward the close application of time and talents to this most vitally important theme; for it is believed the temperance reformation commenced in this way. </p> <p> Donations will be received by the Editors of the Genius of Temperance, and the Editor of the Emancipator, 126, Nassau street. A part of the money has already been raised by a few ladies in Massachusetts. It is hoped that others, who are opposed to slavery in the church of Christ, will speedily forward enough to make it up to $50, when the sum will be given to him who shall show most conclusively to the christian church and to christian ministers, their duty to “Break every yoke.” The essays which shall be written for the prize, are to be judged, and the premium awarded, by ________ </p> <p>[N.B.—The blank will be filled, when the money is subscribed.]</p>		Charles Denison (1809-1881) was an important early agent of the American Anti-Slavery Association.

  LILLY, Wait, &amp; Co. have just published a beautiful 18mo volume containing
  272 pages, with the above title. It is furnished with questions, rendering it
  suitable for use in Sunday schools. The work has undergone a careful revision,
  by a clergyman of the Episcopal Church, residing in the western part of this
  state, and may be considered a valuable addition to Sunday school literature.
  We believe it will be acceptable to Christians generally, being free from
  everything of a sectarian character. To the volume is prefixed a neat Map of
  the countries traveled and the places visited by the Apostle. This map is on
  red ground with white letters, a style of engraving which we have not before
  seen in American books. It produces the best effect.

  It requires but little foresight or political discernment, to know what the
  Democratic party in this State, will have to encounter, in the shape of a foe,
  at the coming election. Thus far, the enemy has been sly in his movements, and
  silent in his plans. But all this is only to give the more power and effect to
  his attack, when it is made.
</p>
<p>
  In various parts of the State, steps have already been taken by our opponents,
  which cannot be misunderstood. The spirit of hostility is beginning to
  manifest itself, and if the signs of the times do not deceive us, the votaries
  of Democracy, have much to do to render permanent their glorious emancipation
  from the galling chains of federalism. There is no danger, if our friends will
  make a proper use of their strength.
</p>
<p>
  In this county, we are stronger than we were last spring; and what is still
  more cheering, we have the influence of the Unionist against us!

<p>
  ☞We are gratified to learn, by the last number of the Unionist, printed at
  Brooklyn, that Mr. Frederick Olney, a reputable and truly excellent citizen of
  Norwich, who was taken up by Andrew T. Judson &amp; Co. on a charge of having
  fired Miss Crandall’s dwelling a few weeks since, has been acquitted. The
  Unionist says—‘The Jury would probably have given their verdict without
  leaving their seats, if they had previously chosen a foreman. But so
  soon&nbsp; as they had returned to their room and organized, they gave a
  unanimous vote in his favor.’ The same paper gives a long report of the trial,
  which shows that a more paltry and vile attempt to incriminate an honest man
  was never made in our land.

  “MISS CRANDALL’S SCHOOL. One of the children now in that school is the
  daughter of a poor woman in the city of New-York who obtains a living by her
  daily labor. Of course she is unable to give her children an education, and
  this child is
  <em>supported by another woman, who was once a slave,</em>
  and purchased her freedom by her own exertions. Another of Miss C’s scholars
  is the daughter of a father who was himself a slave.

  Where can we find such thirsting for knowledge among our white

  who has risen from a state of the lowest degradation by her own unaided
  exertions, under the weight of all the prejudices which are crushing her in
  the dust, against the seemingly irresistible tide of public opinion which is
  ever setting against her—I say, where can we find a person with a white skin
  who has risen from such a situation, and
  <em>taught himself</em>
  the real worth of man, the real dignity of the human mind, and the exalting,
  ennobling power of education, to such as extent that, although by no means in

  1834.
</p>
<p>Present, Hon. Judges Eaton, Griffin and Chase.</p>
<p>State vs. Frederic Olney</p>
<p>
  <em>Mary Burleigh.</em>
  —This witness stated the same general facts as before stated, and added that
  when she came down into the keeping room, before dinner, she perceived a bad
  smell—that after dinner, she returned to the keeping room, perceived a little
  smoke in the room, where the rays of the sun were, and the smell was so
  disagreeable that she took the paper which she was reading, and went up stairs
  <em>(sic)</em>
  to the school room. On her cross examination, being asked if she named the
  subject of the smell at the time; did the evening after, to Miss P. Crandall
  and others; heard Olney say after the alarm was over, that if it had not been
  for the fire, he should have been gone, or away in a few moments.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Maria Harris</em>
  testified that Olney came to the kitchen from the keeping room soon after his
  arrival and asked if he could not have some breakfast; that he came from home
  early and had not eaten any; witness asked Charles to bring some biscuit from
  the closet; After Olney had eaten he went back to the keeping room; then came
  back, and staid till dinner time; did not go out of doors, only went to the
  cellar kitchen; Olney ate dinner and staid some time in the kitchen
  afterwards; witness had just got ready to wash her spoons &amp;c. as Olney
  left the kitchen to go to the keeping-room; she had not washed any as she
  recollects when she heard the cry of fire; it was possibly five minutes after
  Olney left the kitchen when she heard the cry.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Cross-Examined.</em>
  Olney took his loose coat when he left the kitchen and said he was going to
  bid Miss Crandall good bye, or that he was going to see her a few moments and
  must then go to Brooklyn; do not know whether he put his coat on or not; don’t
  remember seeing him put it on.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Betsey Fish</em>
  was in the cellar kitchen when Olney came down first; he staid perhaps fifteen
  minutes; did not go out of doors but returned up stairs; left Olney at dinner
  when she finished.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Charles Harris</em>
  (testified to preliminary facts same as others.) Saw Olney in the keeping room
  writing before dinner and not long afterwards he brought witness a letter and
  asked him to carry it to the post-office; witness carried it when they were at
  dinner; after dinner Olney said he was going to Brooklyn, that he would go and
  bid Miss Crandall good bye before he started; this was in the kitchen; very
  soon he heard fire cried; ran out and saw smoke at the corner of the house;
  got an axe and Olney struck into the corner and the smoke burst out; witness
  then went and rang the bell and people immediately came; he took up the carpet
  in the keeping room after he got back; it was nailed down round the edge at
  the corner and elsewhere; it was snug and tight and filled up the crack; it
  was nearly new, thick, and bound around the edge; has examined it to see if it
  was singed and found it was not; no scorch on it or on the mop-board; Olney
  struck the mouldings on the east side of the corner at first, but could not
  start them; he then struck on the north side and the smoke came right out; the
  letter which witness carried to the post-office was directed to a ____
  Marshall; don’t remember the first name.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Cross examined.</em>
  Delivered the letter at the office when they were eating dinner at Miss
  Crandall’s; said nothing about this before the Justice’s Court; don’t now
  remember whether he then said that he went but once out of the kitchen and
  that was to carry wood to the fire; thinks he was not out but this time that
  he speaks of; don't remember having been at Jenk’s store about noon; did not
  go there from the post-office but went directly home; don’t remember having a
  conversation with two persons at Col. Judson’s corner when he went to the
  post-office; when Olney left the kitchen he said he would bid Miss Crandall
  good bye and start for Brooklyn; saw clapboards cut off when he came back from
  ringing the bell; [sic]
</p>
<p>
  <em>Elizabeth Marshall</em>
  resides in the city of New York; on the 23d or 24
  <sup>th</sup>
  of January last Olney left New York and took a letter, and bundle &amp;c. to
  her little daughter at Miss Crandall’s school at Canterbury; witness had
  before sent a bundle to her daughter which had miscarried in October last;
  Olney said he would write to witness as soon as he got to Canterbury and tell
  her whether he had found it or not and also tell her about her daughter; the
  Saturday night of the week following Olney’s departure from New York, when
  witness returned home from her work, her eldest daughter told her that she had
  got a letter from Olney, and read it to her. (witness not being able to read);
  [The witness here produced a half sheet of letter paper written over, which he
  said was the letter paper written over, which he said was the letter read to
  her by her daughter; it was dated Canterbury January 28
  <sup>th</sup>
  1834, and purported to be a letter from Frederic Olney to Mrs. Marshall; the
  other half of the sheet, which was the one containing the direction and post
  mark witness said she had used to light her lamp one morning, soon after
  receiving the letter, having risen before it was light.]
</p>
<p>
  <em>Mary Jane Benson.</em>
  After dinner at Miss Crandall’s on the day of the fire, witness went from the
  dinner table in the kitchen to the keeping room in company with Miss Willis
  and others; soon after entering the keeping room Miss Willis asked, what
  smells so? witness replies that it was like old chestnut wood burning; Olney
  was at this time eating his dinner in the kitchen; witness went from the
  keeping room into the space and fro thence she thinks she went to the school
  room; don’t recollect seeing any smoke.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Cross examined.</em>
  The conversation about the smell was after dinner, as soon as she had done;
  don't remember whether any one was in the keeping room when they came to it;
  those with witness were Miss Willis and Miss De Grasse, &amp;c.; don’t
  remember that any but Miss Willis asked as to the smell: had no particular
  business in the room, and did not remain in it more than two or three minutes;
  do not recollect whether she had spoken to any one of this but Mr. Tyler;
  “don’t remember how the conversation was then introduced; don’t recollect that
  Mr. Tyler said to her that other girls had stated a similar story.
</p>
<p>[The defendant’s counsel here rested their testimony.]</p>
<p>The counsel for the prosecution then called</p>
<p>
  <em>Charles Harris,</em>
  who being asked, if Olney had not been requested by Miss Crandall not to visit
  at her house, said not to his knowledge, witness has never said so.
</p>
<p>
  <em>William Kinne</em>
  was called by Miss Crandall to examine her house after the burning, and did
  so; has looked at it twice; if the fire was introduced under the mop-board it
  would have gone to the place where the most burning was; for this reason
  thinks the fire was set from the inside; the inside of the sheathing board was
  burned most; thinks the fire began on the sill.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Cross-examined</em>
  Did not ascertain whether the bottom of the sill was burnt or not; the line
  was discolored in some places, in others not; he differed from the majority o
  those who examined with him as to the origin of the fire.
</p>
<p>
  <em>George Middleton</em>
  examined the house with the committee from the Insurance Company; concurs
  generally in their statements and thinks the fire caught from within.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Andrew Harris.</em>
  (Large fragments of the house were brought into court, which were put together
  by Dr. Harris, who explained at length their situation and appearance; Dr
  Harris was not present at the fire but examined the house carefully at
  different times afterwards. Being asked his opinion as to the origin of the
  fire, he answered that he had not been willing to form an opinion on the
  subject, and did not think the question could be answered except by
  probabilities.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Mary Harris</em>
  was at her father’s when the stage stopped at Miss Crandall’s; saw the driver
  get down and take off bundles; a man alighted and stood on the east side of
  the horses; tried to ascertain if he was Olney; the man with the driver got
  down; the driver stood on the box a part of the time; he stepped down to take
  the reins from Olney and then returned to his place.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Mrs. A. T. Judson</em>
  saw the stage stop at Miss Crandall’s; the driver left his box and gave the
  reins to Olney; did not at this time know Olney; saw him afterwards; a woman
  got into the stage from Miss Crandall’s; did not see Olney get out; witness
  left her window before the stage started; the driver carried in one box.
</p>
<p>
  <em>George S. White</em>
  was now called by defendants counsel to explain the appearance of some parts
  of the timber shown by Dr. Harris; not remembering in relation to them.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Albert Hinckley</em>
  was again called, and gave the explanations.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Elkanah C. Eaton.</em>
  was again called by the counsel for the prosecution, and stated that when he
  examined the house, the sill was firm upon the mortar; the outer edge was
  burnt nearly to the bottom; that he assisted in putting the timber together as
  they were before the fire, and there was no chance of any communication from
  without except where the pointing was out; expressed an opinion as before that
  the fire caught from within.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Betsey Fish</em>
  was again called by defendant’s counsel, and she stated that she brought the
  first pail of water; that it was turned in at the corner below, while Olney
  was cutting a hole to come at the fire.
</p>
<p>
  The testimony being closed on both sides, A.T. Judson Esq. opened on the part
  of the prosecution, D.P. Tyler Esq. opened on the part of the prisoner and was
  followed by the Hon. Calvin Goddard on the same side; C.F. Cleveland Esq.
  closed for the prosecution.—It seemed to be tacitly admitted that the fire was
  caused by design. The counsel for the prosecution claimed that the fire was
  communicated from within and that it was done by Olney. The opposing counsel
  insisted that the balance of proof was that the fire was communicated from
  without, but whether from within or from without, no testimony whatever had
  been adduced tending to show that Olney was guilty. The charge of his Honor
  Judge EATON was brief, but distinguished for its ability and impartiality. The
  jury retired, and after a short absence returned a verdict of
  <em>not guilty.</em>
</p>
<p>
  The trial occupied the court from 2 o’clock in the afternoon of Thursday, till
  6 o’clock P.M. on Saturday. F.

Abolition of Slavery in Antigua	<em>The Unionist</em> 1834-04-10	Abolition; Foreign News	"<p>
  ABOLITION OF SLAVERY IN ANTIGUA.—We have received an Antigua paper of Feb. 19<sup>th</sup>, from which we learn that the Legislature of that Colony had passed an Act
  for the total Abolition of Slavery on the 1<sup>st</sup> of August next. On the 21<sup>st</sup> November, the Governor, at the instance of the Legislature, addressed the
  British Government, desiring to know whether immediate and unconditional
  abolition on the 1<sup>st</sup> of August, would be accepted by the Government, in lieu of the system of
  gradual emancipation contemplated by the Act of Parliament. On the 13<sup>th</sup>
  of Feb. a reply having been received by the Governor, the Legislature met by
  special summons. The reply was then read, announcing that the wishes of the
  Legislature were perfectly consistent with the views of the government, and
  with the spirit of the Act of Parliament. Thereupon an act was passed by the
  Assembly on the 13<sup>th</sup> Feb., and by the Council on the 15<sup>th</sup>, of which the following is the principal section:
</p>
<p>
  Sec. 1.—
  <em>May it please your most Excellent Majesty,</em>
  That it may be enacted, and be it enacted by the Governor and Commander in
  Chief of Your Majesty’s Islands of Antigua, Montserrat, Barbuda, Saint
  Christopher, Nevis, Anguilla, the Virgin Islands and Dommica and the Council
  and Assembly of this Your Majesty’s Islands of Antigua, and it is hereby
  enacted and ordained, by the authority of the same, that all and every person,
  who on the first day of August, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-four,
  shall be holden in slavery within this Colony or its dependencies, shall upon
  and from and after the said first day of August one thousand eight hundred and
  thirty-four, become, and be to all intents and purposes FREE, and discharged
  of and from all manner of Slavery, and of and from the obligations imposed by
  the said herein before in part recited Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom
  of Great Britain and Ireland, entitled “An Act for the Abolition of Slavery
  throughout the British Colonies, for promoting the Industry of Manumitted
  Slaves, and for compensating the persons hitherto entitled to the services of
  such Slaves;” and shall be absolutely and forever Manumitted; and that the
  children thereafter to be born to any such persons, and the offspring of such
  children, shall in like manner be free from their birth; and that from and
  after the said first day of August, one thousand eight hundred and
  thirty-four, Slavery shall be, and is hereby utterly and forever abolished,
  and declared unlawful within this colony and its dependencies.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The vote
  was unanimous. When signing the bill, the Speaker said, in a tone audible only
  to those very near him. “The most important paper to which I ever put my
  hand.”

  cold, damp air, and walk slowly, as he did, a mile to his lodgings, might have
  been deemed imprudent in one whose health was less precarious than his then
  seemed.
</p>
<p>
  ”That night he complained of a slight indisposition, and in the family worship
  of the evening prayed with an unusual fervor, and seemingly a foreboding
  spirit which he communicated not save to his God. But even this was sufficient
  to excite vague apprehensions in a family always ready to note and to dwell
  upon whatsoever might seem to bode danger or safety to a friend so dear.
</p>
<p>
  On Monday he was confined to his room; no serious apprehensions were
  entertained, but a physician was called in—it was only a cold. On Tuesday he
  was worse, but we feared not the result. He complained of stiffness of the
  muscles of the throat and swelling of the glands—milk poultices were applied
  to his face, but they gave not relief. On Wednesday he was much worse so much
  as to excite alarm; on the evening of this day it was first discovered that
  the disease was Erysipelas, ”a new enemy,” of which Mr. Wirt then expressed
  his fears. “It was not the foe with which he had been so long accustomed to
  contend.”
</p>
<p>
  His constitution was too weak, as the physicians apprehended, to stand the
  vigorous treatment which would have been most efficient in destroying the
  disease. By Friday, the alarm had become very serious—the door was crowded by
  anxious inquiring friends, and those who met in the street asked from each
  other the latest intelligence. The affliction of the family was extreme, but
  there was still hope. On Saturday, his daughter and son-in-law arrived from
  Baltimore, and were shocked to find the case so much worse than their worst
  fears.
</p>
<p>
  Scarcely a glimmer of hope was left to us, but this feeble ray was most
  anxiously watched and cherished. When once shadowed by so deep a gloom, the
  least of the twinkling stars in the firmament is more precious to our sight,
  than is the sun itself in the noontide of an unclouded day.
</p>
<p>
  Death from the first day of his illness, had continued to approach with a
  steady pace, and in a form more than usually hideous. The fine countenance so
  bright with intellect, was sadly altered—by the disease partly, and partly by
  remedies so fruitlessly applied. The eyes had lost their speculation—the
  eloquent voice was hushed—the divinity had departed from the temple, and its
  walls were defaced, but light still lingered, loath to abandon a habitation
  which had so long given to a thing in itself so little desirable and so
  worthless, beauty, purity, and worth.
</p>
<p>
  The attending physicians were Doctors Hunt and Hall; none could have been more
  anxiously attentive; the latter staid by him every night of the last four or
  five.
</p>
<p>
  About noon on Monday, consciousness returned; and he had power to speak a few
  words. Nature had made a last effort to permit him to take leave of his family
  and friends, to give them assurance that he died in christian hope, and to
  join them in prayer to his God. The Rev. Mr. Post officiated. In so much of
  the prayer as related to his family and his own acceptance with heaven, he
  seemed heartily to join—but when a petition was offered that he might be
  restored to health, he audibly dissented “no, no!” He had done and suffered
  enough in this contentious world, and was entitled to the release and the
  transfer to a higher existence, which the good and just are authorized to
  expect.
</p>
<p>
  It was now become manifest, even to the most sanguine, that recovery was
  beyond the remotest probability. He was too shining a mark for death longer to
  miss. All that was left to us was to smooth his passage to the tomb—to moisten
  his parched lips and tongue, and perform such little offices of affection as
  might soothe his last sufferings.
</p>
<p>
  During the last eighteen hours, he was tranquil as a child. Breathing and
  warmth were the only evidence of life—no motion, no pain, no consciousness,
  there lay the wreck of WILLIAM WIRT.
</p>
<p>
  Three friends besides the clergymen attended his bedside during the night—his
  family too, worn as they were by nearly a week’s constant watching, could not
  be induced to take repose. Anguish and affection gave them strength to bear
  what would have exhausted the strongest men It was a night long to be
  remembered—a night of silent, despairing sorrow, which conveys to the heart a
  language never to be forgot, a language which is not for a pen like mine to
  transcribe.
</p>
<p>
  Tuesday morning breaks upon the scene still unaltered, save that life
  fluttered more faintly and all pulse was gone. About 11 o’clock the breathing
  became gradually more distant and more feeble—was suspended or
  imperceptible—another breath—he’s gone! So calm, so imperceptibly did he make
  his exit, that the precise moment of his departure could scarcely be
  marked—without a sign or a struggle his bright spirit has departed from
  amongst us to a state of existence higher, mightier, and more glorious.
</p>
<p>
  Upon a highly excited mind a slight incident will sometimes make a deep and
  lasting impression. As the last flickerings of life were failing—while his
  whole family, and the friends who had watched with them, were grouped around
  his bed, and in silent, deep attention to the awful scene, all held their
  breath, and their hearts and pulse stood still, a few soft, low notes from a
  pet bird, which had before been so silent that its presence in the room was
  unremarked, fell with startling sweetness on the ear. Only once before during
  his illness, had it been known to sing. On the preceding day, at the
  conclusion of the last act of devotion in which he ever joined, these same
  soft notes had mingled with the solemn ‘Amen.’

Peter of Russia	<em>The Unionist</em> 1834-04-10	Foreign News	"<p>PETER OF RUSSIA</p>
<p>
  We have always thought that Peter the Great was more worthy of that epithet,
  than any Prince to whose name it has been affixed. Peter was a great man. He
  was truly GREAT. His intellect was of the highest order—and his sole study
  through life was to make his subjects wiser and happier. He introduced among
  barbarians the arts and the courtesies of civilized life—and he paved the way
  to the grandeur of the Russian Empire. His name is never mentioned by a
  Russian but with the utmost veneration and respect. Peter the Great was a
  <em>practical Mechanic.</em>
  He was a carpenter and a blacksmith—and his tools are now preserved with great
  care in the Museum of St. Petersburgh, and are pointed out to strangers with
  all the marks of devotion which are exhibited by good Catholics, when exposing
  to the unhallowed gaze of heretics, the holiest relics.
</p>
<p>
  Peter built one of the noblest maritime cities in the world, and thither
  removed his Court. He introduced the European discipline into his armies—and
  taught them to fight and conquer. He laid the foundation for a navy, and
  furnished his artificers with models of naval architecture constructed by
  himself. He facilitated communication through the different parts of his
  immense Empire by making public roads, some of which were upwards of
  <em>one thousand miles in length!</em>
  He established manufactories of various kinds—the first of which was pins. He
  made just laws and caused them to be respected.
</p>
<p>
  But more than all, the Russian women have reason to bless the memory of Peter.
  Previous to his reign, women in Russia were not allowed to see their intended
  husbands until their nuptial day—and among the presents which the bridegroom
  received from his bride on this important occasion was a handful of
  rods—intimating that if she should ever conduct improperly, she was ready to
  submit to marital chastisement. After marriage the husband never allowed the
  wife to be seated at the same table with him—he could even kill her with
  impunity. On the other hand, a woman who murdered her husband was sentenced to
  be buried alive! But Peter, knowing well the humanizing influence which woman
  exerts over the character of man, caused laws to be enacted in her favor—and
  raised her from a slave to become the companion of man !”—

"	Not sure if this is the "SUN" of NY or London	Peter the Great (1672-1725, r. 1682-1725) did much to bring Russia into the orbit of Europe, and built it into an empire. Highlighting his liberalization of laws related to women is an interesting indication of growing pro-feminist consciousness.	Peter I
A Remarkable Incident	<em>The Unionist</em> 1834-04-10	Miscellaneous Filler	"<p>From Zerah Colburn’s Memoirs.</p>
<p>A REMARKABLE INCIDENT.</p>
<p>
  “In the beginning of 1815, a circumstance took place that excited much
  interest in Paris. A surgeon in the army, named Dautun, was arrested in a
  gambling house, in the Palais Royal, on the testimony of a scar on his wrist.
  Some time previous, the officers of the night had found while passing their
  rounds, in different parts of the city, four parcels tied up; one containing
  the head, another the trunk, a third the thighs, and a fourth the legs and
  arms of a man. In the teeth, tightly compressed, was a piece of human flesh,
  apparently torn out in the dying struggle. The parts were collected, and put
  together in their regular order, and exhibited for a number of days at the
  Morgue. The mystery which involved this dark transaction excited quite an
  interest, and numbers went to see the corpse. The general and only conviction
  was that he must have been murdered; but for a number of weeks no clue was
  obtained to elicit information on the subject. When it became at length
  improper to keep the body any longer above ground, a cast in plaster was
  taken, fully representing the murdered victim, and this remained a much longer
  time for the public to see. At length Dauton happened to be engaged in
  gambling at the Palais Royal; he played high and lost, called for liquor to
  drink, and angry because the waiter was somewhat tardy, when he came with it
  Dauton emptied the glass and threw it at the waiter. It was shivered into a
  thousand pieces, and a fragment was carried into Dautun’s wrist, under the
  cuff of his coat. The spectators gathering around, and learning the accident,
  wished to see the gash; he drew down his sleeve, and firmly pressed it round
  his wrist; they insisted on seeing it, he obstinately refused. By this course,
  the bystanders were at length led to suppose that something mysterious was
  involved in this conduct, and they determined at all events to see his wrist.
  By force they pushed up his sleeve, and behold a scar recently healed, as if
  made by tearing out of flesh, appeared. The landlord had been at Morgue, and
  seen the murdered man with the flesh between the teeth, and it struck him in a
  moment that the flesh was torn from this man’s wrist. Charging them to keep
  him safe, he hastened to call in the legal authorities, and arrested him.
</p>
<p>
  In the event, Dautun confessed that being quartered at Sedan, and out of
  money, he came to Paris to try some adventure. Knowing that his brother had a
  large sum by him, directly on his arrival, he went to his lodgings in a
  retired part of the city, about eight in the evening. He entered the house
  unnoticed by the porter, and passing to his apartment, found his brother
  asleep. He immediately commenced the work of death; his brother waking up
  defended himself, but in addition to the surprise and horror of the moment,
  being in a feeble state of health, all the desperation of his struggle was
  overpowered. In the scuffle he tore out the flesh. Being killed, the surgeon
  cut up the body, tied it up in four parcels as before mentioned, secured the
  money and retired.
</p>
<p>
  He also confessed that eleven months previous he had murdered an aunt, who was
  living with a second husband, to obtain money. Her husband was arrested and
  imprisoned for a number of months, but as nothing appeared to criminate him,
  he had been discharged. The writer saw the unhappy fratricide on his way from
  the prison to the place of execution.

  In the 13

  <sup>st</sup>
  Rep. W. Hungerford 965 to 833; 2d “______ Hanks 932 to 798 both Anti Jackson
  men. In E. Hartford, E. Windsor, (majority 140) Enfield, Manchester,
  (reported) Wethersfield, Middletown, Durham, Winchester, Coventry, (reported)
  Avon, have gone Anti-Jackson. Southington doubtful. Glastonbury, Suffield and
  Mansfield are reported to have gone for Jackson candidates.
</p>
<p>
  THE ELECTION.—The returns so far as received, give strong indications that
  Jacksonism in this State is prostrated. Last year every town in the 13
  <sup>th</sup>
  District was represented by Jackson men, now only one Jackson man* goes from
  this district. The 14
  <sup>th</sup>
  District had two or three representatives who were either wholly Jackson men,
  or sometimes acted as such; now we believe not a man goes from that district
  who is not decidedly Anti-Jackson. Last year the Jackson party carried one of
  the Senators in this county. This year both Senators are Anti-Jackson, and
  elected by decisive majorities. Instead of a respectable majority
  <em>for</em>
  Pearl, as was the case last year, the 13
  <sup>th</sup>
  District now gives more than 300 majority
  <em>against</em>
  him. The intelligence which we have received from other quarters is of much
  the same character. Hartford, represented last year by Jackson men, has now
  elected the Anti-Jackson candidates by nearly 150 majority. In several other
  towns from which we have heard, similar changes have taken place. There is
  scarce room for doubt that Governor Edwards will be elected—to quit the office
  as soon as his present term expires, and that the whole Anti-Jackson State
  ticket will succeed, if not already chosen by the people. We would not affect
  an indifference which we do not feel at this result, for it is the
  accomplishment of the wish which we expressed in our prospectus, that the rule
  of the present dynasty might be brief; but though we rejoice, we feel no
  disposition to indulge in extravagant exultation at the defeat of Jacksonism.
</p>
<p>
  * With the exception of one, who, however, if we have been rightly informed,
  generally acted with that party in the Legislature.

  “Although we entertain not the slightest doubt as to the success of Mr. Pearl
  in the 13
  <sup>th</sup>
  Senatorial District, we cannot but urge upon our friends in every town in this
  district, the necessity of prompt action at the ballot boxes on Monday next.
  It is not enough that we merely elect our candidate. Let us show our friends
  in other parts of the State, that we are as strong in numerical numbers, (
<em>numerical numbers!</em>
) as we are zealous in defence

  What a sagacious prediction! And how wonderfully verified by the event! Mr.
  Pearl, of whose success ""we have not the
 <em>slightest</em>
  doubt,” and who was even to have been elected by an increased majority, such
  was the strength in “<em>numerical numbers,</em>” of the Jackson party in this district, comes between three and four hundred
  votes short of an election; and his opponent is chosen by a majority of more
  than three hundred. What an “accession” to the strength of the self-styled
  democratic party! For some reason or other, it would seem that the plain,
  honest, intelligent <em>people</em>
  of this district can’t be made to believe that Democracy and Jacksonism
  <em>are</em>
  precisely synonymous terms, and the old Democrats are so obstinate, that they
  won’t act as if they did believe it when they don’t. How much their confidence
  in the assertions and predictions of the Advertiser will be strengthened by
  the result of this election we cannot exactly say, but no doubt the election
  of Anti-Jackson representatives in every town in the county except one, and
  there of a doubtful one, and the choice of both the Anti-Jackson Senators by
  triumphant majorities, will have due weight in the people’s minds in settling
  that point, as well as in estimating the future prospects of Jacksonism in
  this country.

FOSTER, a young gentleman of acknowledged skill and fidelity as a reporter; and
in this presenting to the public an impartial statement of the testimony in the
case, we cannot but repeat our expression of astonishment that a man should have
been arrested and bound over for trial, against whom there was not a shadow of
proof—not even enough to have fixed suspicion upon a man of generally suspicious
character, much less upon Olney, whose character stands as fair, as that of any
person concerned in his arrest, examination, or trial. A man who can come out
from such a trial, not only with a triumphant acquittal, but with a character so
perfectly fair and unimpeached, notwithstanding all the pains which had been
taken beforehand to hunt up something against him—the inquiries among his
fellow-townsmen, where a man’s errors are likely to be known if he has committed
any serious ones—has certainly abundant reason to complain of the injustice of
being subject to so much trouble and expense on so slight grounds—rather so
utterly without any grounds, as Mr. Olney has been. We do not much wonder that
the Advertiser, the organ of those concerned in the arrest and prosecution of
Olney, should contain a Report of the evidence, (probably from the pen of Judson
himself, or some of his partizans,) so discolored in various parts, as to have
quite a different impression on the mind of readers who heard none of the
testimony, from that which the testimony itself would have left if they had
heard it. We do not much wonder, for instance, that the Advertiser’s report
should entirely leave out that part of Maria Robinson’s testimony in which she
says that Mr. Olney had not been alone in the room more than a minute before the
fire was discovered, thus showing it to have been absolutely impossible that he
could have fired the house. We mention this as one example of the accuracy of
that report, but any one who will compare it carefully with Mr. Foster’s, will
find many other features of dissimilarity calculated to weaken the strongly
unfavorable impressions which an accurate report would have produced, towards
those at whose instance Olney was arrested.

Witty Letter to the Editor about Elections	<em>The Unionist</em> 1834-04-10	National News	"<p>COMMUNICATIONS.</p>
<p>For the Unionist.</p>
<p>
  MR. EDITOR—Old Plainfield is “redeemed, regenerated and disenthralled” from
  the degrading bondage of Jacksonism. “We have met the enemy and they are
  ours.” Last year we gave a majority for Pearl as Senator, and had besides the
  honor and felicity of being represented in the Assembly by one thorough-going,
  avowed Jacksonman and one who though not nominally a Jacksonian is said to
  have always acted with that party, with as much fidelity as if he had been one
  of them. Now you know, Mr. Editor, this shows a laudable contempt of party
  trannels, for certainly no one ought to refuse his support to good measures,
  merely because they are the measures of the opposite party, and if the
  measures of the opposite party happen to be <em>all</em> right, why, they ought
  <em>all</em> to be supported—and yet, you know, it would hardly be right even in that case for a man to <em>desert</em> his own party. So we suppose our representative thought; but I did not sit down to tell you about last year, any more than just enough to give you a
  better idea of what we did this. Considerable activity was displayed by both
  sides in the electioneering campaign before hand. The Jackson recruiting
  sergeants were flying about with great spirit, sensible, doubtless, that their
  case being desperate required a desperate effort. And you may depend upon it,
  our friends did not look on and see all the bustle of the Heroites with folded
  hands and half closed eyes. They were awake and warning the honest people of
  the tricks and maneuvres of the self-styled democratic party, and the people
  needed only a word of caution to put them on their guard. The Jackson leaders,
  after beating up for recruits, and counting noses all about town, came to the
  conclusion, it seems, (and a pretty correct conclusion it was too,) that if
  they attempted to run a full-blooded, acknowledged worshipper of their idol,
  they should only run their head against a post, at the very first push; so
  making up their minds that policy (not that which the old proverb calls “the
  best policy” neither, for of that our Jackson leaders would be forced to say
  as David did of the armor with which Saul girded him, “I have not assayed
  it,”) must supply the place of strength, they pitched upon a worthy man whose
  temper and disposition they considered such that they could mould him to about
  the right shape when elected, but who has never been called a Jackson man, and
  whom, in fact, they took care themselves to represent as no Jackson man, and
  him they resolved to run for their first candidate. To make the trick work the
  better, they took some pains to create an impression among the genuine
  republicans that this gentleman was to be one of the candidates of the
  republican party, hoping no doubt thereby to divide our ranks, and by uniting
  all the Jackson strength with a part of ours, to defeat our regular ticket,
  and thus dishearten us, and run with increased strength for their second
  candidate, who we shrewdly guessed would be the Chief Judge of our County
  Court—the same who was sent from our town last year. But though the plan was
  cunningly formed, and all preliminary measures taken with admirable skill,
  still somehow it wouldn’t work. Though some of the republicans—not aware
  probably of the plot—voted with the Jacksonians, yet the greater part were too
  wide awake to be managed in that sort, as the vote declared. For the first
  representative 287 votes were cast, of which Mr Goff, our candidate, received
  157, Mr. Cady, the <em>not Jackson</em> candidate of the Jackson party, 74, Judge Eaton 2 or 3, and two of three others one apiece.</p>
<p>
  This result was a damper, and as a natural consequence led them to relinquish
  the first order of battle, and instead of risking the Judge, to try their
  former candidate again; but some of the subalterns not getting their cue soon
  enough, had begun with commendable zeal to distribute votes for Mr. Eaton and
  had gone at least far enough to satisfy us what the original plan was, before
  they were stopped by the higher authorities. Not that the superior officers
  were at all negligent or remiss in checking the well meant, but ill judged
  activity of their less prudent partizans as soon as they discovered what was
  going on, for I chanced to see one of them, an <em>illustrious</em> member of the bar, as well as sharer in some small degree of the “spoils” of
  former campaigns, stepping about quite nimbly and giving the necessary orders
  to restore, as far as possible, that union which they had like to have lost by
  their own maneuvres. The result of the over forward promptitude of the
  subalterns appeared on counting the votes for a second representative, when it
  was found that 238 had been case—153 for Mr. Knight, our candidate, —62 for
  Mr. Cady, and some dozen or twenty or such a matter for Mr. Eaton.
</p>
<p>
  The votes for Senator, Governor &amp;c. exhibited a still more cheering
  result, but as you will probably insert them at length, I shall add nothing
  respecting them, except that I was pleased to see how the freeman stood at
  their posts instead of quitting as they too often do, immediately on the
  choice of representatives. This appears from the number of votes given for
  each officer. First Representative 237, second do. 233, Senator 235, Governor
  237. I have already told you how the Jacksonites carried matters last year,
  and I will add that by referring to the Presidential vote in 1832, I find that
  Jacksonism has sustained a net loss in this town since that time, of about 60
  votes.

  Mr. Editor, “How are the mighty fallen!” Jacksonism and Judsonism, recently so

  of our gallant Col. to ride into office on the storm of an anti-negro
  excitement have utterly failed, and discomfited and chagrined, the Col.
  declares, as I am told, that the Canterbury people may take care of the black
  school for themselves—he fights against it no longer. Alas for us! Who shall
  now head our opposition against that nuisance, that abomination in our eyes!
  Verily, if the Col. deserteth the post he has so bravely occupied the past
  year, it will be to the opposers of the school “as when a standard bearer
  fainteth.” But I intended to tell you something of the contest, which has
  terminated in such a disastrous overthrow of the Col’s party here. At our
  first trial for representative, we failed of making a choice, and Col. Judson
  had a plurality of two or three votes or so over Baldwin. The second trial
  however showed the Col’s folks how the freemen when fairly waked up, could
  “shed fast atonement for the first delay.” The Col. had the leave of about 60
  majority of the electors, to enjoy the sweets of domestic felicity and of
  neighborly intercourse with his kind friends on the green, uninterrupted by
  the cares of office.
</p>
<p>
  We now tried for our second representative, and I leave you to guess how the
  subjects of two Andrew’s twisted and turned to get their beloved in. Mr. Lyon
  of course could not expect to take the second chance if the Col himself lost
  the first so he stood back as in duty bound, for his superior officer, and the
  struggle was between Clarke and Judson. Now we Westminster chaps have an idea
  that Clarke is about as fit for any office in our gift as the Archbishop is,
  or ever was, and so we gave him to understand as much by our votes. We have no
  notion of supporting black laws or black law men, or Jacksonmen or Judsonmen.
  The Col’s efforts to buy up the Antimasons by an offer of a share in the
  spoils of victory proved unavailing. Our Antimasonic neighbors think that
  those who offer the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them, or any part
  and parcel thereof, had better be sure they have them to give, before
  <em>they</em>
  fall down and worship, for such considerations, and then they won’t bow the
  knee to
  <em>such</em>
  a Baal as our Judsonian friends set up. Mr. Judson accordingly was again
  notified by 70 majority, that we don’t want him to go to New-Haven on our
  account this year. I presume he understands our meaning by this time, for if
  he didn’t comprehend it at two intimations, he must have begun to guess what
  it was by the time we had given about a hundred majority against his
  candidates for Senator, Governor &amp;c.

Abolition essay	<em>The Unionist</em> 1834-04-10	Abolition	"<p>
  It is almost mathematically certain that the Colonization Society with its
  present sentiments and organization, can never effect the abolition of slavery
  in the United States. This Society was organized, January 14, 1817. During the
  seventeen years of its existence it has, (free blacks aside) transported on an
  average almost sixty a year who had been slaves, but which were not
  emancipated by the society. The increase of our slave population is known to
  be about 60 thousand a year, or about 170 a day. Should things continue in
  this ratio, it may be seen, that while the society (bankruptcy of $40,000
  aside) is transporting one emancipated black to Liberia, which it has done
  nothing toward manumitting, more than a thousand have been added by births!
  When a distinguished friend, therefore, of the society acknowledges that if
  the society should remove the whole in a hundred years it is as soon as could
  reasonably be expected, has he not fixed the period quite too soon? Would not
  the end of time be quite a probable? Besides, who can doubt that from a
  population of 2,000,000 as many as that would have been manumnitted had no
  such society existed. And had the funds which have been expended for their
  outfit, transportation, and mal-administration of the colony, been
  appropriated to their education and comfortable settlement in this their
  native country, how much more honorable as well as righteous in those who have
  so long and sorely oppressed them!
</p>
<p>
  A New-England citizen thinks he has presented the public with a good offset to
  calculations like the above, by stating that Mr. G. (the American Wilberforce)
  has been engaged for several years, and the Anti-Slavery society two years and
  have emancipated one boy in Boston. And thinks the enquiry ""When will the
  society remove the entire population of our country?” will apply with more
  force to the Anti-Slavery society, than that of the Colonization. And
  especially (he thinks) as when it is remembered that laws preventing
  emancipation and oppressing the colored people, have been passed in many
  states since the Liberator and other similar publications have been in
  circulation. But who does not see a wide difference in the prospective view of
  these societies? As the Colonization Society disavows any intention to
  interfere with the RIGHT of the slave holder, why, of course, he may dwell in
  peaceable fellowship with him forever, whether he is willing to release
  another slave or not. Now the Anti-slavery Society not only avows for its
  object the abolition of slavery entirely, but its object is to act on the
  entire population EN MASSE whose prerogative it is to remove oppressive laws,
  and to awaken and correct public sentiment on this subject, against which no
  system of wickedness can long hold out, whether legalised or not. The
  emancipation of the boy in Boston therefore, is but an incidental affair;
  while at the same time it is a test of the society’s sincerity and efficiency.
  Should the Colonization Society ever exceed the prescribed limits of their
  object, so as to turn their attention to an enslaved boy in Boston or
  elsewhere, it will doubtless refuse to incur the expense and trouble of a
  prosecution and wait patiently the pleasure of his holder to voluntarily
  release him, which perhaps will be at the termination of the slave’s life.
</p>
<p>
  While therefore, the above mentioned case is a test of the vigor of the
  society, it may also stand like the Egyptian which Moses slew and the Hebrew
  which he defended, prelusive of the final and complete deliverance of that
  unhappy and enslaved people. He supposed that his brethren would by his hand
  deliver them; “<em>but they understood it not.</em>” As to the oppressive laws enacted since the efforts of the friends of
  liberty, I should hardly have thought that a man with the views and feelings
  of a New-England man would have dared to utter them, as it cannot fail to call
  up to the mind of every reader the policy of Pharaoh and his counsellors. It
  appears then, that there is the strongest analogy between the two immediate
  precursors of the Hebrew’s deliverance, and circumstances among ourselves,
  viz: their increase of population and their increased oppression; “and when
  the time drew near” “the people grew and multiplied in Egypt. Acts VII, 17.
  “For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this
  people; neither hast thou delivered them at all.” Ex. V-23. I hope the
  opposition will not be carried to the same extent as it was by the
  Anti-abolitionists of Egypt, because I love my country. It is believed by many
  thinking men that slavery cannot hold out thirty years longer in this country;
  and that its extermination, or the dissolution of our union is near. If these
  men are fanatics, is it not a little singular that they are so on this subject
  only?
</p>
<p>
  The reason which a “New-England man” and others love to assign why they cannot
  co-operate with abolitionists is, that Mr. G. has uttered and published some
  extravagant things. This objection is as unsatisfactory as it is disingenuous.
  Many of the friends of the anti-slavery society have thought so too, and
  regretted it. Be this as it may, they think it unfair for the fourth of July
  orators to be constantly calling out those expressions, which they deem
  exceptionable, and presenting them in a garbled manner, without their
  qualifications, and in senses quite different from what was intended, and then
  attempting to fix an odium on the society. No allowance is made for the
  peculiar &amp; extraordinary situation in which Mr. G. has been, and still is
  placed. He is the first man who has dared to publish a paper devoted to the
  cause of the oppressed colored man of this country. He has been thrown into
  prison; five thousand dollars offered for his apprehension&nbsp; by the
  legislature of a state, and two thousand five hundred by an association of
  <em>Gentlemen</em> in S. Carolina, denounced as the veriest fanatic that ever existed; and
  doubtless has enlisted a combination of the worst passions against himself,
  that ever occupied the human breast. No body doubts that Mr. G. has the most
  numerous and virulent enemies of any other individual in this country. Add to
  this that he has thrown his whole soul into the cause which he pleads, and who
  that retains a vestige of candor will refuse to overlook the sally of an
  unguarded expression, or make a man an offender for a word? If the objection
  above-mentioned by sufficient to justify the refusal to co-operate, why, on
  the same principle we may cling to Popery, and refuse to co-operate in the
  Protestant cause. Nothing tried the friends of Luther more than his violent
  and daring expressions. They were considered by both friends and foes as
  injurious to the cause he advocated; yet it is a question not fully settled
  whether a man less ardent and more prudent, would have succeeded quite as
  well. He saw distinctly as did many others that his cause on the main was
  right; and many now perceive, (their number fast increasing) that the
  prominent features of the abolitionists are those of truth and justice, and
  will most assuredly prevail.&nbsp;&nbsp; N.B. (author)

George Benson Sr. on Abolition	<em>The Unionist</em> 1834-04-10	Abolition	"<p>Liberator.</p>
<p>THE SPIRIT OF SEVENTY-SIX</p>
<p>
  The following extract we venture to make from a long epistle recently
  addressed to us, by the venerable GEORGE BENSON of Brooklyn, Connecticut, the
  present estimable President of the New-England Anti-Slavery Society. He is an
  abolitionist of the old school, and commenced at the earliest period with
  Clarkson and Wilberforce, for the suppression of the foreign slave trade.
  Although far advanced in years, he is in vigorous possession of his mental
  faculties; and his hand writing is firm and plain, to a marvel.
</p>
<p>
  “I observed in a late Boston paper, that the annual meeting of the Peace
  Society was to convene in that city. Several weeks since I addressed a letter
  to a friend in Hartford, who is actively engaged in the Pacific cause, and
  informed him that I considered the cause of Peace and the abolition of Slavery
  to be so inseparably connected, that wherever one society existed, the other
  should be located&nbsp; in its vicinity; and my opinion originates from the
  import of the sacred hymn, chanted by the angelic host at the advent of our
  blessed Saviour—‘Peace on earth and
  <em>good will to men.</em>
  ’ And how can we exercise this good will on a more important and urgent
  occasion, than to rescue our fellow men from the matchless and oppressive
  cruelties of slavery?
</p>
<p>
  It is universally admitted that the first Congress in the United States was
  composed of the most pure and enlightened citizens, who, on the 6
  <sup>th</sup>
  of July, 1775, announced the following sentiments:
</p>
<p>
  ‘If it were possible for men, who exercise their reason, to believe that the
  Divine Author of our existence intended a part of the human race to hold an
  absolute property in, and unbounded power over others, marked out by infinite
  goodness and wisdom, as the objects of a legal domination never rightfully
  resistible, however severe and oppressive—the inhabitants of these
  Colonies might at least require from the Parliament of Great Britain, some
  evidence that this dreadful authority over them has been granted to that
  body.’
</p>
<p>
  May not the poor slaves emphatically adopt the same inquiry of their lordly
  oppressors?
</p>
<p>
  Again, in 1779, a pamphlet appeared, published by order of Congress, which
  contains the following opinion:
</p>
<p>
  ‘The great principle (of government) is, that men are by nature free, as
  accountable to Him that made them, they must be so, and so long as we have any
  idea of Divine Justice, we must associate that of human freedom.’
</p>
<p>
  Now, it appears evident to me, that the above recited sentiments authorize and
  sanction an avowed opposition to slavery, and even censure those who think
  otherwise, as being destitute of any correct opinion of Divine Justice.

—We are informed by two gentleman who lately passed through Syracuse, N.Y.
that Mr. Avery, proprietor of an extensive iron foundry in that place, has made
a most important discovery in relation to the casting of iron. The best kind of
earth used in foundries, is brought we believe, from Canada. Mr. Avery analyzed
this earth and found it to contain proportion of blue clay. Following this up by
a series of experiments, he discovered that if common fine sand was mixed with
common blue clay in the proportion of one tenth part of clay to nine tenths of
sand, it would constitute the best composition for casting that he had ever
used. The most delicate casting came out free from sand; requiring no cleaning
by vitrol. He dismissed 10 of his cleaners on the spot. Mr. A. has taken out a
patent for the discovery, and thinks it will make an immense saving the expense
of iron foundries.—

The Question Settled	<em>The Unionist</em> 1834-04-10	Canterbury Female Academy; African-American Students; Education; Race; Vigilante Violence; Prudence Crandall; White Opposition	"THE QUESTION SETTLED.----The Windham County Advertiser, (the determined opponent
of Miss Crandall,) in speaking of the late trial of Mr. Olney, says—It “was a
patient examination of facts, and
<em>all who heard it admit that the fire was communicated by design.”</em>
Very well. This settles one point, and we may say the only point in which the
American public at large, have any particular interest: and we will add, that on
that point, there is a most intense interest felt throughout the country. It is
simply this—Whether the house of Miss Crandall took fire by accident, or whether
it was fired by some person or persons, determined to
<em>“break up”</em>
the school. As to the miserable attempt to cast suspicion upon the friends of
the school, it will be an utter failure. Nobody of sound mind and principles
will listen to it. It is out of the question. Miss Crandall and her sister and
pupils are too well known, and too
<em>favorably and honorably</em>
known throughout the land, to be made objects of suspicion. A similar remark
might be made respecting Mr. Olney, who is well known in this city, and whose
character is as unimpeachable and well established as Judge Eaton’s. Besides, he
stands acquitted and “all” who heard the evidence, “admit that the fire was
communicated BY DESIGN!!!
<em>This settles the question forever,</em>
before the impartial jury of the American public, who will of necessity infer
<em>that</em>
&nbsp;the fire was communicated by the same class of persons who pelted the
house with stones and addled eggs, who filled the well with filth, and
threatened to “break up the school.” For the honor of human nature, and
especially of Windham county, (the land of our boyhood,) we had hoped that there
would remain some ground for the opinion that the fire was
<em>accidental.</em>
We are sorry to learn, and from the source least likely to admit it, that such
is not the fact. One question, however, of minor importance still remains to be
settled, and that is
<em>which</em>
of all the persons in high life and in low, that have so virulently opposed the
school of Miss Crandall, have been guilty of this base act? This question, which
it concerns the decent and respectable portion of those opponents, chiefly to
settle, is a question to which it would seem that the (fortunately for
themselves,) possess no unmeaning clue. One of their members (the editor of the
Advertiser) appears to have been favored, some time before hand, with intimation
of the fact, that an attempt would be made to “break up the school.” Let him
frankly reveal the source of his information, and let these informants be
required to name
<em>their</em>
informants, and so on, and there is little doubt that those villains will be
detected, and all honest men exculpated, at a cheaper rate than the adoption of
useless and abortive measures to throw suspicion on the innocent.—

Ruggles' style matches this enthusiastic prose,The editorial prominently highlights the Black students as ""<em>favorably and honorably</em>

"	Link to Celia Burleigh in Burleigh project eventually	"James Whitcomb (1804-1880) was a prominent figure in Windham county for many decades. He was already deeply engaged in defense of the Canterbury Female Academy when <emThe Unionist</em> was started, since he is noted as accompanying Samuel J. May to the ""calling"" of Charles Burleigh to its editorship (see letter of Gertrude Kimber Burleigh to Samuel May, Jr., November 14, 1857). In addition to his medical work - which was extensive - he was a founding member and first corresponding secretary of the Brooklyn (CT) Anti-Slavery Society in 1835. His first wife, Mary Louisa Whitcomb, was a charter member of the Brooklyn Female Anti-Slavery Society. He was a friend to the Benson family, and was known by the young William Lloyd Garrison. He was credited with using his house as a station on the Underground Railroad; see Horatio T. Strother, <em>The Underground Railroad in
Connecticut</em> (Middletown CT: Wesleyan University Press, 1962), p. 134, 211.
Whitcomb served as a surgeon in the Civil War, a war in which his son Edwin perished. After the war, as a member of the Unitarian Society in Brooklyn, he invited Celia Burleigh to preach - one of the first women to be an official preacher in Connecticut. Celia Burleigh was the second wife, and later widow, of Unionist co-editor William H. Burleigh"	James Whitcomb

</p>
<p>The pamphlet in question, for instance, compared the Canterbury Female Academy students to impressed sailors (one of the alleged causes of the War of 1812):
  “The war of the revolution was a contest for principle. Had the principle in
  question been yielded, who could have set limits to the acts of oppression
  growing out it ? So also in our war for sailors’ rights, the bone of
  contention was, the right of search and impressment. The mere fact that a few
  seamen had been injured and abused, was as nothing, aside from the principle
  involved. This, in common with that of the revolution, was a contest for
  principle, and the oppression resisted was the oppression of principle. And
  further, whence the utter odiousness and the cruel oppression of the far-famed
  ‘black law’ of Connecticut? Not that Miss Crandall and a few colored Misses
  are subjected by it to certain shameful acts of cruelty and oppression. These
  are as nothing, comparatively, except as they involve principle; and the law,
  which allows and sanctions them, is itself comparatively harmless and
  innocent, except as it involves principle—principle which puts in jeopardy the
  rights of thousands.</p>  <p>Amos A. Phelps,

Advertisement for Parley's Magazine	<em>The Unionist</em> 1834-04-10	Advertisements with Education Theme	"<p>CIRCULAR</p>
<p><em>TO PARENTS, TEACHERS, SCHOOL COMMITTEES,</em></p>
<p><em>And all who feel an Interest in the Improvement of Youth.</em></p>
<p>
  It is not yet quite a year since Parley’s Magazine was commenced. During that
  short period the number of subscribers has increased to 20,000, and the work
  has received, every where, the most unqualified approbation. It has found its
  way to thousands of families, and while it has entertained the social circle,
  its unobtrusive lessons have, we trust, often had a
  <em>salutary influence</em>
  on the
  <em>juvenile mind</em>
  and
  <em>heart.</em>
  It has also found its way to the school room; and many classes of young pupils
  have been cheered twice a month by the welcome voice of their teacher
  bidding them to lay aside for a few days, the class book which they have read
  over and over, perhaps twenty times, and read the pages of Parley’s Magazine.
  The demand for the work, to be used in schools, is rapidly increasing.
</p>
<p>
  Encouraged by such unexampled success, the Publishers have resolved to render
  it still more worthy so liberal a patronage; and not to remit their exertions
  till they see it introduced into families and schools, throughout the whole
  length and breadth of the United States.
</p>
<p>
  In this view they have secured new aid in the Editorial department. The late
  Editor of the Juvenile Rambler, who, in addition to his qualifications as a
  writer for the young, has the advantage of many years experience as a teacher,
  will henceforth assist in conducting it.
</p>
<p>
  We propose to present, in the progress of each volume, a great variety of
  interesting and important topics, among which are the following.
</p>
<p>
  I.Natural History—Of beasts, birds, fishes, reptiles, insects; plants,
  flowers, trees; the human frame, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>II.Biography—Especially of the young.</p>
<p>III.Geography—Accounts of places, manners, customs, etc.</p>
<p>IV.Travels and Voyages, in various parts of the world.</p>
<p>
  V.Lively Descriptions of the Curiosities of
  <em>Nature</em>
  and
  <em>Art—</em>
  in each of the United States, and in other countries.
</p>
<p>
  VI.Lessons on Objects that daily surround Children in the Parlor, Nursery,
  Garden, etc. Accounts of Trades and Employments.
</p>
<p>
  VII.Particular Duties of the Young—to Parents, Teachers, Brothers, Sisters,
  etc.
</p>
<p>VIII.Bible Lessons and Stories</p>
<p>IX.Narratives—Such as are well authenticated—Original Tales</p>
<p>
  X.Parables, Fables, and Proverbs, where the moral is obvious and excellent.
</p>
<p>XI.Poetry—Adapted to the Youthful capacity and feelings.</p>
<p>
  XII.Intelligence—Embracing Accounts of Juvenile
  <em>Books</em>,
  Societies, and
  <em>Remarkable Occurrences.</em>
</p>
<p>
  Many of these subjects will be illustrated by numerous and beautiful
  engravings, prepared by the best artists , and selected not only with a view
  to
  <em>adorn</em>
  the work, but to improve the taste, cultivate the mind, and raise the
  affections of the young to appropriate and worthy objects. We would make them
  better brothers, better sisters, better pupils, better associates, and, in the
  end, better citizens.
</p>
<p>
  We beg the friends of education—especially parents and teachers, to view the
  matter in this fight. Let children look upon the pictures, not as pictures
  <em>merely;</em>
  but let them be taught to
  <em>study</em>
  them. What can be more rich in valuable materials for instructive lessons than
  a good engraving?
</p>
<p>
  After this brief explanation of our principles and purposes, we ask the
  co-operation of all who receive this Circular. Will you aid us, by your
  influence, in this great work—the formation of mind and character for the
  rising generation? Will you assist us all in your power, in our endeavors to
  introduce to American schools, and parlors, and firesides, the stories and
  lessons of Parley’s Magazine?
</p>
<p>
  Every single number of the new volume will have a strong paper cover,
  abundantly sufficient to preserve the work in good order for binding and for
  use in schools.
</p>
<p>
  The yearly subscription being but one
  <em>dollar</em>, our friends will perceive the impracticability of keeping open so many
  thousand accounts. It is therefore indispensable that we should require
  payment always in advance.
</p>
<p>
  Two numbers more will close the first year, and we now give this notice that
  all who desire to continue the Magazine, may signify their intention by a
  seasonable advance for the second year.
</p>
<p>
  In any of the subscribers should not receive all their numbers, they can
  request the Post-Master to notify us of such as are missing, and they shall be
  sent again free of charge.
</p>
<p>TEN COPIES FREE OF POSTAGE.</p>
<p>
  To accommodate ASSOCIATIONS, SCHOOLS, and INDIVIDUALS, for distributions, we
  will deliver at any Post-Office in the United States,
  <em>free of postage,</em>
  TEN COPIES TO ONE ADDRESS for TEN dollars remitted to us without cost.

<p>We parted in silence, we parted by night,</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the
  banks of that lonely river,
</p>
<p>Where the fragrant limes their boughs united,</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We met—and
  we—parted forever!
</p>
<p>The night-bird sang, and the stars above</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Told many a
  touching story
</p>
<p>Of friends long passed to the kingdom of love</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the
  soul wears its mantle of glory.
</p>
<p>We parted in silence—Our cheeks were wet</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the
  tears that were past controlling;
</p>
<p>And we vowed we would never—no, never, forget;</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And those
  vows at the time were consoling.
</p>
<p>But the lops that echoed the vow of mine</p>

<p>And that eye, the beautiful spirit’s shrine,</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has
  shrouded its fires forever.
</p>
<p>And now on the midnight sky I look,</p>

<p>Morn on the waters! and purple and bright</p>
<p>Bursts on the billows the flashing of light;</p>
<p>O’er the glad waves, like a child of the sun,</p>
<p>See the tall vessel goes gallantly on;</p>
<p>Full to the breeze she unbosoms her sail—</p>
<p>And her pennons stream onward, like Hope, in the gale;</p>
<p>The waves come around her in murmur and song—</p>
<p>And the surges rejoice as they bear her along;</p>
<p>See! she looks up to the golden-edged clouds,</p>
<p>And the sailor sings gaily aloft in her shrouds;</p>
<p>Onward she glides amid ripple and spray,</p>
<p>Over the waters, away and away—</p>
<p>Bright as the visions of youth ere they part,</p>
<p>Passing away like a dream of the heart;</p>
<p>Who, as the beautiful pageant sweeps by—</p>
<p>Music around her and sunshine on high—</p>
<p>Pauses to think amid glitter and glow,</p>
<p>O! there be hearts that are breaking below!</p>
<p>Night on the waves! And the moon is on high,</p>
<p>Hung like a gem on the brow of the sky—</p>
<p>Treading its depths in the power of her might,</p>
<p>And turning the clouds, as they pass her, to light!</p>
<p>Look to the waters! asleep on their breast,</p>
<p>Seems not the ship like an island of rest,</p>
<p>Bright and alone on the shadowy main—</p>
<p>Like a heart-cherished home on some desolate plain?</p>
<p>Who,—as she smiles in the silvery light,</p>
<p>Spreading her wings to the bosom of night,</p>
<p>Alone on the deep as the moon in the sky—</p>
<p>A phantom of beauty!—could deem with a sigh,</p>
<p>That so lovely a thing is the mansion of sin,</p>
<p>And souls that are smitten lie bursting within?</p>
<p>Who, as he watches her silently gliding,</p>
<p>Remembers that wave after wave is dividing</p>
<p>Bosoms that sorrow and guilt could not sever,</p>
<p>Hearts that are parted and broken forever?</p>
<p>Or deems that he watches afloat on the wave,</p>
<p>The death-bed of hope, or the young spirit’s grave!</p>
<p>‘Tis thus with our life as it passes along;</p>
<p>Like a vessel at sea, amid sunshine and song,</p>
<p>Gaily we glide in the gaze of the world,</p>
<p>With streamers afloat, and with canvass unfurled—</p>
<p>All gladness and glory to wondering eyes,</p>
<p>Yet charted with sorrow and freighted with sighs;</p>
<p>Fading and false is the aspect it wears,</p>
<p>As the smiles we put on just to cover out tears—</p>
<p>And the withering thoughts which the world cannot know.</p>
<p>Like heart-broken exiles, lie burning below—</p>
<p>Whilst the vessel drives on to that desolate shore,</p>
<p>Where the dreams of our childhood are vanished and o’er.</p>

An Irish servant lad	<em>The Unionist</em> 1834-04-10	Humor; Miscellaneous Filler	"An Irish servant lad, going along the passage, and singing rather
inharmoniously, was asked by his master what horrid noise he was making? “I have
not made any noise, sir,” he replied. “Why, you were singing, and a confounded
noise it was.” “Oh, perhaps it was the singing of my ears your honor heard.”
This reminds us of a dialogue between two ministers of the gude kirk of
Scotland. One complained that he had got a ringing in his head. “Do ye ken the
reason o’ that?” asked his worthy crony. “Na!” “I’ll tell ye; ‘tis because it’s
empty!” “And have ye never a ringing in your head?” quoth the other. “Na,
never.” “And do ye ken the reason?,’ “Na.” “It’s because it’s cracked!” was the
retort; and the truth was not very far off.
"		Humor based on ethnic stereotypes and denigration is, as usual, prevelant in the human condition but not our best feature. However, the reference to things which are cracked opens the window to the use of The Liberty Bell as a symbol by the Abolitionists. They adopted it both because of its use of the Biblical phrase "Proclaim LIBERTY Throughout all the Land unto all the Inhabitants Thereof" (Leviticus 25:10), and yet also the patent lack of extending freedom to all the inhabitants that the persistence of slavery represented. The Abolitionists rescued the Liberty Bell from post-revolutionary obscurity and made it a potent icon for freedom once again.

Advertisement for Godey's Lady Book	<em>The Unionist</em> 1834-04-10	Advertisements	"<p>
  THE LADY’S BOOK,
  <em>
    a monthly Magazine, of original and selected Tales, Poetry, Essays, and
    Music, embellished with several hundred engravings, and quarterly plates of
    the Philadelphia Fashions, superbly colored.
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  When, about four years ago, the Lady’s Book was submitted to the test of
  publication; the proprietors made no professions likely to create expectations
  which they could anticipate even an improbability of realizing: they were
  determined nevertheless progressively to adopt every improvement which
  diligent anxiety to please their patrons should suggest; and have now the
  remunerating satisfaction, after having faithfully and steadily pursued their
  course, of seeing it sanctioned by a circulation more extensive than that of
  any other monthly journal in the United States, and as this extent of
  patronage is the most admissible evidence of its past utility, it is offered
  as the best guarantee for its future excellence. The literary department of
  the Lady’s Book is of admitted superiority; for in conjunction with the great
  but boasted liberality with which they encourage the development of
  <em>Native Authors,</em>
  they possess facilities of selection, through their foreign agents and
  correspondents from works of which
  <em>no other copies</em>
  are sent to this country.
</p>
<p>
  Among the many claims which the Lady’s Book has on the patronage of Americans,
  the least is not, that it was the first publication to present correct
  representations of the newest fashions of female costume, and in that respect
  it may fairly claim a superiority over all other contemporaries: for we
  proprietors seldom calculate the expense of rendering it altogether deserving
  of its increased and increasing patrons.
</p>
<p>
  Never was the title of a book more justified by its contents than that of the
  Lady’s Book—Literature, foreign and domestic—selected and original—Engravings
  on steel and wood, of scenery, distinguished persons, fashions and embroidery,
  all rich and beautiful, and from the hands of the most eminent artists. Its
  literature select, free from dullness, though teeming with usefulness, and
  conveying pleasure and amusement through the extensive medium of delicate
  discrimination. To musical amateurs of both sexes, the Lady’s Book offers many
  advantages, each number being accompanied by a popular piece, arranged with
  accompaniments for the piano forte, &amp;c &amp;c. under the
  <em>surveillance</em>
  of competent persons, and to its pages the general reader can always turn and
  find amusement, novelty, and instruction.
</p>
<p>
  Each number shall, as hitherto, average 60 pages of extra royal octavo letter
  press, printed with clear, new and beautiful type, on paper of the finest
  texture and whitest colour. It will continue to be embellished with the most
  splendid engravings on copper and steel, embracing every variety of subject,
  and the quarterly numbers will as heretofore contain figures of Philadelphia
  Fashions, two and occasionally three, beautifully and faithfully colored, to
  commence with the January number, being No. 1 of the eighth volume. It may be
  necessary to say that these engravings are designed, drawn and engraved,
  expressly for this work, by competent persons, specially engaged for that
  purpose.

</p>
<p>THE UNION NO. 1, OR CHILD’S FIRST BOOK.</p>
<p>
  The arrangement of the lessons in this book is such that the child commences
  reading as soon as he commences putting the letters together into syllables!
  the (sic) exercises of spelling and reading being simultaneous. The plan has
  met with the unqualified approbation of those teachers who have used it, and
  who have had an opportunity of expressing their opinions.
</p>
<p><em>THE UNION NO. 2, OR CHILD’S SECOND BOOK.</em></p>
<p>
  This is a continuation of the first number, containing easy reading lessons,
  most of which are pleasing stories, designed to interest the mind of the
  learner and afford instruction.
</p>

<p>
  This is a gradual advance from the second number, having the reading and
  spelling lessons arranged on the same plan.

  containing a variety of other useful matter.

  with an explanatory Key, containing much useful information; and a large
  collection of verbal distinctions with illustrations.
</p>
<p>
  500 pp. Designed as a reading book for the highest classes in Academies and
  Schools.
</p>
<p>
  The whole forming a series of interesting, useful and economical school books.
</p>
<p>
  They have been through several large editions, and the publishers have had the
  whole series stereotyped, so that future editions will be uniform in every
  respect. They have spared neither pains nor expense to render these School
  Books worthy of attention.
</p>
<p>
  These books are used exclusively in the Providence public schools; have
  obtained an extensive circulation in Philadelphia and other parts of
  Pennsylvania. They have been introduced into most of the enterprising and
  intelligent country towns in Rhode-Island, and many towns in other parts of
  the United States. The publishers have the pleasure to state that not a single
  teacher, or other competent person has, to their knowledge, ever disapproved
  of these books after having fairly examined them. Numerous testimonials are in
  possession of the publishers, from which they select the following.

  Dear Sir:—Among my political engagements, I have always found some leisure
  moments left me for literary amusement. The employment of the School Master,
  once so useful and dear to me, does now, at times, call me back to the
  examination of letters, syllables, words, spellings and readings. Perhaps I
  mingle with all these some political considerations; for I confess, that my
  anxiety for the preservation and perpetuation of our Union and National
  Government, is so great, that I often ardently wish all the children in the
  United States could be taught to read from the same set of books. Not because
  this might give a uniformity of pronunciation throughout the country, so
  desirable to Poets and Orators; but more than this, because the same juvenile
  literature studied and read, in the same language, would go far to give to
  each succeeding generation not only the same knowledge, but something like a
  brotherhood of feelings, sentiments, and opinions, than could, in any other
  way be obtained. I know you as a citizen, feel a deep interest in all this;
  and because you, as one of the highly useful and laborious fraternity of
  Printers and venders of books, may have a peculiar interest in some of those
  put forth for the instruction of children, I shall, at this time, press on
  your attention this subject in connexion with the best which I have yet seen.
</p>
<p>
  Our worthy fellow-citizen, Mr. Oliver Angell, seems to have had purposes much
  akin to my wishes, when he composed and published his system of classics for
  children. He had named his books the “Union;” and if you look quite through
  them, you will find nothing in the whole, for the reading of children, but
  that spirit and those principles which alone can preserve the Union, the
  purest morals, piety and patriotism. There is, also, a progression in the
  readings found in these books, admirably contrived to go along with that of
  the human mind in its growth from childhood up to perfect maturity.
</p>
<p>
  In mere orthography, the alphabet, the vowels, consonants, dipthongs,
  syllables, spellings, perhaps Mr. Angell might have done better for the
  <em>Instructor</em>
  who may use his books; but after all, it will be found doubtful if any one can
  do better for the
  <em>Pupil</em>
  for whom this good man seems alone to have been solicitous. The Instructor
  should carry in his head, the correct pronunciation of every word in our
  spoken language, and a key for all the various sounds of every letter in all
  its various combinations whenever he looks at that language as it is printed
  or written.
</p>
<p>
  We have more vowels in our spoken than in our printed or written language; and
  those who compose spelling books have supplied the deficiency by figures added
  to the printed character of each vowel. These Algebraic vowels, half letter,
  half figure, used in spelling books, are not printed in books of any other
  kind; so that a child, though he may have learned the different sounds of the
  printed vowels and can pronounce them when he spells; yet when he comes to
  read in other books, where one half of each vowel is omitted and it becomes
  thereby a new letter, he knows not how to pronounce it; and he must, at last,
  learn its different sounds in the different combinations of each with other
  letters. This would have been easier done, at first, when he was spelling,
  than, at last, when he is reading. Last or first, he must learn them, from the
  Instructor, or from the dictionary; and the Algebraic vowels, called the key,
  while useful to the Instructors themselves not well instructed, may be
  detrimental to the pupil. On the whole, I have seen no system of School Books
  equal, or any where near equal to Mr. Angell’s Union; and I think if they
  could be universally used in our English Schools in the whole country, our
  children would become not only better scholars, but better patriots, not less
  citizens of Rhode-Island, or South-Carolina and more citizens of the United
  States.

<p>
  <em>From the Preceptors of the Public Schools in the City of Providence</em>
</p>
<p>
  We have used Mr. Angell’s series of school books, for nearly one year; and
  from this long trial we can say with confidence that we believe them admirably
  suited to answer the purposes for which they were composed. From our
  examination of the inferior numbers, which are used in the primary Schools, we
  believe them also to be no less useful. As reading books, they all combine in
  our opinion, many peculiar excellencies. The first, which will strike all who
  use them, is their perfect
  <em>adaptation</em>
  to the
  <em>capacities</em>
  of those for whom they were designed. This, we consider a most important
  advantage in an elementary book, and one which has not been heretofore
  sufficiently attended to.
</p>
<p>
  The books put into the hands of children at school have generally been
  altogether
  <em>above the understanding</em>
  of the young mind; and the consequence has been, that the scholars have not
  only made much less progress in a given time, but have acquired the lasting
  <em>disgust</em>
  for their studies which has operated as an effectual bar to future
  improvement. To this great and extensive evil, Mr. Angell’s books afford a
  <em>certain and easy remedy.</em>
  The facility with which his lessons are
  <em>understood</em>
  added to their very interesting nature, causes them to be read by the scholar
  with eagerness and delight; by which means his love of study and his
  improvement in learning are both successfully promoted. The introduction of
  spelling lessons, in connection with reading lessons, into all the books, is
  an advantage which they possess over those previously in use. This
  arrangement, by enabling the pupil to become acquainted with each separate
  word, immediately before he is called to read them, is well calculated to
  render that exercise correct and pleasing, at the same time that it renders
  orthography a less dry and uninteresting study than the usual mode. It also
  considerably promotes economy by rendering the purchase of a separate spelling
  book unnecessary. The
  <em>appending of questions</em>
  to each reading lesson we consider a very valuable improvement, since, by
  calling the attention of the pupil more closely to the subject, it will lead
  him to a better understanding of what is read. The natural gradation from what
  is easy, to what is more difficult, which is observed throughout this whole
  series, is a circumstance that renders them peculiarly valuable. Entertaining
  these opinions, we cheerfully recommend them to the attention of teachers and
  others interested in the cause of education; confident, that to all who are
  aware how much success in teaching depends upon proper books, they will be
  peculiarly acceptable. P.W. FERRIS, E.W. BAKER, ESEK ALDRICH, SILAS WESTON,

<p>
  Gentlemen—I have examined with much care and satisfaction, the series of
  “Angell’s School Classics,” with which you were pleased to present me, and
  have not the slightest hesitation to pronounce it just such a set of reading
  books as has long been wanted in our schools. It is my intention, as soon as
  practicable, to adopt the whole series as standard reading books for my
  classes, and I doubt not that if the necessary exertions be made by those
  interested, they will ere long become a favorite standard in all our schools.
  I most cheerfully recommend them to the serious and immediate attention of my
  Philadelphia co-laborers in the field of Education. Very respectfully—Your
  ob’t Servant, J. O’CONNER. Principal of the Classical and English Academy,
  rear of St. Stephen’s Church, and Recording Secretary of the “Philadelphia

  TO MARSHALL, CLARK &amp; CO. SCHOOL BOOK PUBLISHERS, PHILADELPHIA. In
  compliance with your request, I have examined “
  <em>Angell’s Union Series of Common School Classics,”</em>
  and entertain a very favorable opinion of the work. It comprises a course of
  elementary lessons on simple and practical principles, and so far as I can
  discover, imparts throughout, knowledge to instruct the understanding and to
  purify the heart. In common with all productions of like character I could
  wish for extensive circulation in our country. ROBERT VAUX.

</p>
<p>
  From an impression, received and corroborated by a long continued course of
  instruction, in regard to the best methods of communicating knowledge to the
  youthful mind, I am free to confess that the Spelling and reading Books, of
  which Mr. Oliver Angell is the author, are not excelled, in their adaption to
  the purposes for which they are intended by any other books with which I am
  acquainted. Their prominent characteristic is simplicity; and when the public
  mind has taken the stand, to which it seems rapidly advancing, that children
  and youth must understand what they read and what they learn, then at least
  the works of Mr. Angell will receive that patronage, which they so eminently
  deserve. This testimony in favor of that gentleman is designed not as a mere
  puff; but as a just tribute of praise to one who has labored long and
  faithfully for the public good. ROSWELL C. SMITH.

  suitable for use in Sunday schools. The work has undergone a careful revision,
  by a clergyman of the Episcopal Church, residing in the western part of this

  We believe it will be acceptable to Christians generally, being free from
  everything of a sectarian character. To the volume is prefixed a neat Map of
  the countries traveled and the places visited by the Apostle. This map is on
  red ground with white letters, a style of engraving which we have not before

A Volley of Addled Eggs	<em>The Liberator</em> 1834-06-14 (4:24:95)	Canterbury Female Academy; Vigilante Violence; Abolition	"We learn by the last Unionist, printed in Brooklyn, Ct., that its junior editor,

Canterbury Decency Exemplified	<em>The Liberator</em> 1834-06-14 (4:24:95)	Canterbury Female Academy; Vigilante Violence; Abolition	"<p>
  <em>Canterbury decency exemplified.</em>
  —It may not be known to many of our readers that the Junior editor of this
  paper (W.H. Burleigh) has, for several weeks past, been engaged as an
  instructor in Miss Crandall’s school. Such, however, is the fact. We did not
  pause to enquire whether the
  <em>benevolent</em>
  and
  <em>christian</em>
  people of Canterbury would be pleased or displeased with it—or what other
  people might say or think about it—the conviction that we could
  be useful—that we could by our influence, limited though it be, and by
  our example and by our labors assist in the moral and intellectual
  elevation of a race long and grievously oppressed, was sufficient to
  induce us to take the step we have taken. We knew the shameful persecutions
  which Miss Crandall had endured, and were ready to expect that we also might
  receive a share of obloquy. We are willing to receive the censure of a certain
  class. The hate of the bad is the highest commendation a good man can receive.
</p>
<p>
  On Tuesday evening last, as we were returning after the labors of the
  day, to our lodgings about a quarter of a mile south of the village, we were
  saluted, when opposite the house of an opposer of the school, by a volley of
  addled eggs. They poured in upon us like grape shot from a seventy-four—but
  luckily no one hit us. The miscreants who made the assault were concealed,
  like cowards, behind the wall, and owing to this and the dimness of the night,
  we were unable to discern any one. We quickened our pace, and was soon beyond
  the reach of the&nbsp; missiles. As we passed the barn of the individual above
  referred to, however, we perceived that the great door fronting the
  street was wide open, and we made up our mind to receive another volley from
  the garrison which we had reason to suspect was within. Nor were we
  disappointed. Canterbury arguments, in the shape of addled eggs, again poured
  in upon us; but we passed rapidly on, and were soon beyond their reach. We
  know not how it happened, but for some reason we escaped untouched, though
  many were thrown and some struck very near us.
</p>
<p>
  We have a few remarks to make upon this shameful and unprovoked attack. To say
  it is in perfect keeping with the past course of Canterburians is to say
  nothing new. When fathers offer to help tear down the house, and assert that
  they had rather their children should go to hell, than to go to school to Miss
  C. in case she should ever take a white school again—when fathers conspire
  together to starve the school out, and reckless miscreants are thus encouraged
  to attempt to burn it out—when fathers look with complacency, nay,
  with delight upon the depredations already made on Miss C’s property—it
  is not to be wondered at that their children, previously depraved as they are,
  should venture in the darkness of the night to attack an unarmed individual
  who was known not only to
  <em>favor</em>
  Miss C’s project, but to
  <em>assist</em>
  her in the accomplishment of her designs. We are not disappointed. Addled eggs
  are fit instruments for such people—and such people, when engaged in robbing
  their neighbor’s hen-roosts to obtain them, and afterwards skulking behind
  the walls and in the barns to throw them at the passer by, are
  engaged in an avocation for which their capacities seem to be peculiarly
  adapted. We envy them not the distinction which they will inevitably acquire.
  But it would become the parents of such promising youths, if, instead of
  casting impediments in the way of the instruction of others, they would
  instruct their own children in good morals and good manners, and if they
  cannot render them
  <em>useful,</em>
  at least render them
  <em>decent</em>
  . A portion of their leisure time devoted to the laudable object of checking
  the precocious depravity of their offspring, may save them the future
  anguish of witnessing that offspring dangling from the gallows. We hope our
  advice will be taken kindly by Canterbury people.
</p>
<p>
  This article is intended for those only whom it fits. No others will
  understand us as meaning them. We cannot forbear adding, however, as a quieter
  to the vague fears of the parents of Canterbury, that there can be no danger
  of their sons ever marrying any of the colored girls of Miss C’s school
  even if they were so inclined. They must become far more refined, in
  mind and in manners, before they would be able to come in competition
  with the most ignorant and least refined scholar in school.

"		The linguistic similarities between this full letter, and Garrison's summary in the previous edition of <em>The Liberator</em> leads me to believe that the full article was in <em>The Unionist</em> of June 12, 1834.	William H. Burleigh; Prudence Crandall
A Heathenish Doctor: Genuine Colonization Doctrines!!: Response to William Hutchins' denial of racial equality			"<p>
  We have been requested to publish the following extract from an address
  delivered by Doct. Wm. Hutchins, before the Windham Co. Colonization Society,
  at its anniversary held in this town on the 4
  <sup>th</sup>
  of July last. The address referred to, was delivered at a time when the
  community was highly excited on the slavery question, and a good number of
  those, who professed to be abolitionists, were present and heard it. And yet
  no attempt was made at the time to overthrow its arguments, or to counteract
  its influence upon the public mind.* [Here, William Lloyd Garrison inserts the important footnote
  – “This is a wilful and flagrant falsehood. The address was ably reviewed, at
  the time, in the columns of the Brooklyn Unionist, by its intelligent editor,
  Mr. Burleigh, who challenged the heathenish doctor to a public discussion.—ED.
  LIB.”]
</p>
<p>
  It is well known that
  <em>equality</em>
  in every respect, between our white and black population, is a prominent
  feature in the abolition creed. For a time, but very few of the abolitionists
  themselves, were willing to advocate this doctrine in public, but they do not
  hesitate to do it now, on all occasions. If, therefore, any member of that
  association is disposed to answer this extract in a
  <em>direct</em>
  and
  <em>explicit</em>
  manner, he shall have an opportunity to do so in the columns of this paper.
</p>
<p>[actual speech follows]</p>
<p>
  But, says the abolitionist, this country is the black man’s home as much as it
  is yours, and you have no right to drive him from it. Granted. But is it
  inconsistent with benevolence to wish to better his condition by removing him?
  Still it is replied, our duty requires us to make this country a pleasant home
  to him, by removing the civil and social disabilities which now make him what
  he is, a poor degraded being.
</p>
<p>
  Let us examine this point a little. The negro, in the present state of
  society, is denied several political privileges. He is deprived of the right
  of suffrage. He is excluded from all offices of honor and profit. He is
  prohibited by public sentiment from practicing in the several
  professions. He is virtually shut out from many other employments, by which
  his white neighbor earns distinction and wealth. Now, let the law do what it
  can for him—let every political disability be removed,—‘tis a
  consummation devoutly to be wished—establish institutions for his moral
  and intellectual cultivation, and what then? The outworks are indeed forced,
  but the citadel remains yet impregnable. He is
  <em>black,</em>
  and this single circumstance, I am bold to say,
  <em>
    will always be a barrier between him and the white, which he cannot
    overleap.
  </em>
  Educated and accomplished he may be, and protected by the whole power of the
  civil arm, still he
  <em>
    is forever condemned to occupy the lowest point in the scale of social life.
    No form of philanthropy,
  </em>
  no legal enactment can prevent this. There is an imperium in imperio, an
  empire of sentiment and fashion and opinion, an authority of nature and
  instinct, altogether paramount to all written law, and beyond its control. The
  negro, if he be allowed to vote by your side, must act with you as your equal
  every where else. You must meet him with a bright smile of joyous
  congratulation. You must extend to him all the tender charities and courtesies
  of social life. You must give him a seat at your table, a welcome to your
  fireside and to your parlor, a place beside you in your bed. You must
  reciprocate with him all the elegances and refinements of polished society. He
  must be your companion and confidential friend by day and by night, by the way
  side and in the field, in the drawing room of the affluent, as well as
  in the hut of the indigent. He must be allowed to break to you the bread
  of life—to prescribe to you in sickness, and decide in courts of justice
  and halls of legislation, important questions pertaining to your life, liberty
  and property. In all these things, there must be no constraint, but you must
  bind him to your heart of hearts, and most freely and unaffectedly, share with
  him in the delicate sympathies and fond endearments of domestic life. If
  fortune smiles upon him and frowns upon you, you must be content to sit at his
  feet and serve him. Unless you go to this full extent, you degrade him. Admit
  him to a moiety of these privileges, and he will but more keenly feel the loss
  of the remainder. The higher he goes, the more will his avidity increase, to
  reach the summit. Keep back a single social or civil right pertaining to
  entire equality, and that Mordecai in the gate will embitter all his joys, and
  render unavailable the blushing honors he bears so thick upon him. Such is
  human nature.
</p>
<p>
  Now, fellow citizens, need I ask, if it be possible to elevate the black man
  to an equality with the white? If it be, I give up the argument at once. If
  the negro can be treated in this country as it becometh a man, in whose face
  is lighted up the quenchless fire of an undying intellect, and on whose brow
  God has stamped the indelible signet of immortality, the colonization society,
  as far as respects the American negro, is laboring in a worthless cause.
  <em>
    Take the negro home to your heart, and embrace him as your brother, and you
    will save our society much time and expense.
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  Can this be done? I appeal to you not as inhabitants of Heaven or of Paradise,
  not as angels or glorified saints, but as imperfect men and women, tenants of
  this nether sphere, in which bitter is mingled with the sweet, and thorns
  encircle every rose. Are you willing to go all this length in relation to the
  black man? Can you so far conquer your antipathies as to make him your equal
  in the true intent and meaning of this term? ABOLITIONISTS, CAN YOU?
</p>
<p>
  History furnishes no instances of two distinct races of men, holding no
  connection by blood with each other, living together on terms of perfect
  equality. Turn its pages over and look through the long and gloomy annals of
  the past, and you cannot find a single fact of the kind. In order to equality,
  there must be
  <em>amalgamation</em>
  or
  <em>separation.</em>
  When Rome was inundated by a deluge of barbarians, the aboriginals of the
  country were not exterminated, but Hun, Goth, Vandal, and Roman united
  together, and gradually blended into the modern Italians. When Britain was
  overrun by a successive tide of Danes, Saxons, and Normans, the ancient
  inhabitants were in part driven into Wales, and in still larger proportions,
  became incorporated with their invaders. All past experience is opposed to the
  abolition doctrine of ‘prejudice vincible’ without amalgamation.
</p>
<p>
  Fellow citizens, take your stand. Look at the ultimate results of the
  immediate emancipation scheme, and let the overflowings of your benevolence be
  directed to a union of the two races by ties of consanguinity, or to a
  separation between them. If the one be revolting to reason and nature, and the
  other be deemed impossible, then sit down content under a state of things
  melancholy indeed, but remediless and desperate.

Female Anti-Slavery Society	<em>The Liberator</em> 1834-08-16	Abolition; Canterbury Female Academy; Allied Reform Movements - Women	"<p>FEMALE ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY.</p>
<p>
  On Tuesday afternoon last, the adjourned meeting of the ladies of Brooklyn and
  vicinity was held in Mr. Davison’s Hall.
</p>
<p>
  Prayer was offered by Rev. Mr. May. The committee appointed at the previous
  meeting to correspond with other Female Anti-Slavery Societies, reported that
  they had written to the Societies, in Philadephia, New-York and Boston. One
  letter in answer had been received—and that a very interesting one from
  Lucretia Mott of Philadelphia. It was read by Mrs. Herbert Williams.
</p>
<p>
  The meeting was then addressed at considerable length, and in a very
  impressive manner, by Charles Stuart, Esq. He pointed out the peculiarities in
  the character and circumstances of woman, which enable her to be an important
  instrument in all moral reforms.
</p>
<p>
  Mr. William Lloyd Garrison and Mr. May also offered some remarks to encourage
  the philanthropic, for which the meeting was then convened.
</p>
<p>A form of Constitution was then read and adopted as follows:—</p>
<p>
  <em>
    Constitution of the Female Anti-Slavery Society of Brooklyn and vicinity.
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  Preamble.—Whereas the system of slavery which exists in a portion of this land
  is contrary to every principle of humanity, honor, and religion, is derogatory
  to the character of our country abroad, and injurious to its peace and
  prosperity at home, and renders us obnoxious to the righteous condemnation of
  the Most High.
</p>
<p>
  And whereas more than a million of our own sex are now groaning under the yoke
  of an insupportable and most degrading bondage, unprotected by law, or by any
  sense of manly shame, from merciless stripes and cruel outrage, are subjected
  by a traffic in the bodies of human beings, more dreadful than
  <em>death,</em>
  to the sudden and cruel sundering of the most sacred relations of domestic
  life, are deprived of knowledge, and as far as the power of their oppressors
  extends, of the hopes of the blessed gospel.
</p>
<p>
  And whereas the demoralizing influence of this atrocious system, by inducing
  woman to sanction and even voluntarily to practice its barbarities, often
  renders her even more deserving of the commiseration of Christians than when
  she is its involuntary victim,—sin being so much greater an evil than
  suffering.
</p>
<p>
  And whereas an enlightened and Christian public sentiment alone is, under God,
  likely to abolish this atrocious and complicated system of iniquity, to arrest
  from our country the impending judgments of the Almighty.
</p>
<p>
  And whereas, female influence is calculated to effect great good in such a
  cause, as has been abundantly shown in the abolition of British Colonial
  Slavery.
</p>
<p>
  We therefore, in behalf of ‘the suffering and the dumb,’ desiring to exercise
  towards both the oppressor and the oppressed the spirit of Christian
  benevolence, and imploring the Father of all mercies for his guidance and aid,
  in our efforts to subserve his will in this most holy cause, do agree to form
  ourselves into a Society to be governed by the following
</p>
<p>CONSTITUTION.</p>
<p>
  1.This Society shall be called the Female Anti-Slavery Society of Brooklyn and
  its vicinity.
</p>
<p>
  2.The objects of this Society shall be, First, to aid in the diffusion of
  information on the subject of Slavery; to portray its true character; to prove
  its utter indefensibleness on any principle of religion, justice or
  expediency. Second, to promote the elevation of the colored people of our
  country to the equal enjoyment with ourselves of these rights and privileges
  which are acknowledged to be inalienable, as the birthright of man. Third, to
  aid in general the American Anti-Slavery Society in its benevolent objects.
</p>
<p>
  3.Any female approving the principles of this Society, and contributing to its
  funds, shall be a member.
</p>
<p>[Here follow the usual articles for the government of the Society.]</p>
<p>
  Twenty two ladies then subscribed their names as members of the Society—and
  made choice of the following officers.
</p>
<p>
  <em>President,</em>
  Mrs. Herbert Williams

Movements of the Rev. Cap't. Stuart	<em>The New-York Commercial Advertiser</em> 1834-08-07	Abolition; Vigilante Violence; Journalistic Debate	"<p>
  “Some two or three weeks since we published, upon authority so
  respectable as to have been considered altogether unquestionable, an account
  of the unwelcome reception of the Rev. Captain Stuart, of Great Britain, in
  the town of Plainfield, Conn., together with a statement as to his rather
  forcible expulsion from that place. It appears that the account received by us
  was not altogether correct; but wherein it was incorrect, we have not been
  able exactly to ascertain. But for the style of rudeness with which we have
  been assailed upon this subject, we should have noted the inaccuracy of
  the account communicated to us before, although we had not the means of
  correcting it. All the papers contradicting our version of the affair,
  have admitted that disturbances did attend Captain Stuart’s visit to
  Plainfield, but have not informed us as to particulars. The
  <em>Emancipator</em>
  of yesterday, commences an article thus:—
</p>
<p>
  “THE AFFAIR AT PLAINFIELD.—Our readers probably know that during the height of
  the late reign of terror in New York, the Editor of the N.Y. Commercial
  Advertiser, “more the organ of the Colonization Society than any other
  in this city,” endeavored to keep himself and his mob in countenance by a
  ludicrous and apparently approving account of a mob said to have taken place
  in Plainfield, Conn., in which the farmers of that place were described as
  literally driving Charles Stuart out of town with their cart whips.
  <em>The story was not true.</em>
  —But it was true that some unmannerly boys attempted, without success, to
  disturb the lecture. The following is extracted from an account given in
  the Brooklyn (Ct.) Unionist:
</p>
<p>
  “We have called them
  <em>gentlemen,</em>
  though had they been strangers to us, had we not been personally acquainted
  with them, known their high pretensions, the respectability of their
  parentage, their advantages for learning what belongs to the character of a
  gentleman, and that on many occasions they show that they
  <em>do</em>
  know how to conduct with propriety, there is much reason to fear that
  their disorderly behaviour, their indecency and rudeness of language and
  action, would have led us to rank them with the lowest vulgar. As it is,
  however, the graduate of Yale, the undergraduate of another college, the
  students in the academy, the sons of wealthy and respectable citizens of
  Plainfield, of church members and zealous colonizationists,
  <em>
    (for the parents of every Plainfield youth whom we noted in the rabble,
    are decided ‘Colonizationists’) must, we suppose, be called gentlemen, be
    their conduct what it may.—
  </em>
  Much good may the name do them, and may they yet learn to deserve it, though
  we fear ‘twill be a hard lesson for some of them, [undecipherable] any truth
  in the maxims of moralists respecting the [undecipherable]
</p>
<p>
  [undecipherable] than one exception, we
  <em>know,</em>
  and we think [undecipherable]{end of Unionist quote and, by implication, of
  Emancipator quote}
</p>
<p>
  Now in the first place, the introductory remarks of the Emancipator are
  not true. Our account of the Plainfield disturbance
  <em>was not</em>
  published “during the height of the late reign of terror,” but when all was
  tranquil in the week following [it was published July 15
  <sup>th</sup>];—and in the second place, the account of the Brooklyn
  Unionist, (an abolition paper published in the neighborhood of
  Plainfield,) represents the case, if anything, more unfavorably than we
  did.—Indeed our mistake seems to have consisted only in stating that the young
  men cracked their whips while Mr. Stuart was forcibly placed in his waggon
  [sic]. Upon this point, then, we stand corrected.
</p>
<p>
  But a communication under the signature of Captain Stuart himself, which
  appears in the Emancipator, with the prefatory remark that it “was refused
  publication in the Commercial Advertiser,” calls for a few observations. It
  was not because he attempted to correct an error into which it is
  [indecipherable] fallen, that we objected to the publication of his
  article—for that we would very cheerfully [indecipherable] done at any time.
  Our objection arose not only from the inflammatory character of the
  communication, as a while, but from a more weighty consideration still. We
  entirely object to the visit of Captain Stuart among us, as being not only
  uncalled for, but highly improper; and it would be the highth of imprudence
  for him, again to appear before the public, on the subject of his mission,
  either in print, in the pulpit, or at the forum. He seems to be an amiable,
  and we doubt not a good man; but he has no business in this country on such
  an errand. How, for instance, would it be received for an American to
  repair to England, for the purpose of delivering lectures in favor of repealing
  the Act of Union between England and Ireland! Such interference in the
  internal affairs of another nation, would not be permitted, and any
  <em>foreign agent</em>
  attempting it, would very properly be prevented from opening his lips. The
  principle, it will be seen, is precisely the same.
</p>
<p>
  But Mr. Stuart, it appears, is not long to be the only agent from abroad,
  engaged in the work of enlightening our country on the subject of its
  own domestic and social relations. He is soon to be joined by a Mr.
  Thompson, who is understood to be on his way hither as a Missionary from
  some excellent ladies of Glasgow. Mr. Thompson is said to be an able and an
  eloquent man; but we trust that on his arrival amongst us, he will perceive
  the propriety of withholding any displays, either of his talents or his
  rhetoric, on the subject of his mission.—Indeed—and we say it deliberately,
  though with all kindness—we hold that neither Mr. Stuart, nor Mr. Thompson,
  nor any other strangers from abroad, should be permitted to convoke and
  harangue an American assembly upon this question. We doubt not the goodness of
  their intentions; but they are laboring under a sad mistake, as to the path of
  duty. If they have feelings of kindness for the slaves of this country, let
  them remain in their own; or else, if they choose, let them imitate a King and
  a Van Rensselaer, and go among the slaves to preach the Gospel in a manner
  compatible with the laws and usages of those States. The truth is, these
  excellent, though misjudging, philanthropists, do not understand the real and
  inherent difficulties of the case, arising from the essential difference
  in the structures of our respective governments. The British Constitution is
  unwritten, consisting, in fact, of the common law of the realm. Parliament is
  omnipotent; and it had a perfect right, politically speaking, to abolish the
  slavery of its colonies at a blow, if it chose to do so.—Nor—residing as they
  do at a distance of four thousand miles from the colonies—could they
  understand or appreciate the difficulties, and the long train of evils, that
  must inevitably follow in the train of hasty and rash legislation, upon a
  question at once so important and so delicate.
</p>
<p>
  But it is not so in the United States. We live under a written Constitution,
  conferring certain powers upon the general government, and specifically
  withholding others; and among the powers thus reserved, is that of interfering
  with the domestic relations of the several States. So that although the
  general government is paramount in some respects, neither it, nor the state
  governments, nor the people of the free states, have any more right to
  interfere with the slave question, than they have to interfere with the
  nobility and the serfs of Russia, or the manufacturers and their operatives in
  England, or on the question of repealing the Irish Union. The truth—and every
  day’s experience more thoroughly convinces us of the fact—that the slave
  question must be left with the state governments, and the people where
  the evil exists. They understand the subject better than we do; they best know
  how to mitigate its rigors; and, ultimately, to apply the means of cure.
  Meantime let the efforts of American Christians and philanthropists be
  directed in the best and most efficient, and yet legal and inoffensive manner,
  to the moral and social improvement of the slave population, with a view to
  their gradual and ultimate emancipation. Depend upon it, the true method of
  improving the conditions of the slaves, and preparing them for that freedom
  which they must one day be put in possession of, is to pursue a kind and
  conciliatory course towards their masters. To abuse and exasperate them, can
  have only the following effect, viz: that of binding the fetters of the
  slave more strongly—excluding information from him more rigidly—and
  protracting the period of his servitude indefinitely.
</p>
<p>
  With these views we deprecate all improper interference upon the subject. It
  regard to Messrs. Stuart and Thompson, we would treat them with all possible
  hospitality and kindness. We could not allow a finger to be raised
  against them, nor a hair of their heads to be injured.—But they should
  neither of them be allowed again to make any public show in any town,
  city, or village, north of the State of Delaware, upon this subject. We desire
  that it may be perfectly understood, wherever these foreign agents may present
  themselves to agitate the slave question, that they shall not be heard.
  They have no business here upon such a mission. And measures at once the most
  peaceable and effectual, should be adopted to prevent them from scattering

  &nbsp; &nbsp;In another column we have given some account of the outrage
  committed in New York by the partizans [sic] of the Colonization
  Society,* and the opposers of abolition. We feel the deepest shame that such
  violations of the public peace, and of the rights of citizens, should be
  perpetrated in our country, in this age of the world. But as they have
  transpired, we are bound to publish them—and to attribute these wicked
  works to their real authors. Who are they? Who are the incendiaries? Not
  surely the combustible materials which have been inflamed; but those
  unprincipled men who have inflamed them. Not the mob—but the men who have
  gathered, excited, and directed the mob. We say without hesitation, that James
  Watson Webb and Col. Stone should be held pre-eminently responsible for the
  late notorious proceedings in the city of New York. Their papers, ‘the Courier
  and Enquirer,’ and the ‘Commercial Advertiser,’ have been, for more than a
  year past, industriously circulating (through a larger portion of the
  community, than any other paper could,) the grossest misrepresentations of the
  sentiments and purposes of the Abolitionists. They have done all in their
  power to awaken the hatred, and direct the blind zeal of the ignorant,
  reckless, and unprincipled against a portion of their fellow citizens, whose
  only offence is, that they are pleading the cause of bleeding humanity—ay, the
  cause of millions of Americans, who are held in abject bondage, or paralyzing
  degradation. Paragraphs have repeatedly appeared in their papers, which more
  than intimated that any measures should be resorted to, for the suppression of
  the Abolitionists. It was owing to the exertions of the ‘Courier and Enquirer’
  and the ‘Commercial Advertiser,’ that the disgraceful proceedings took place
  there last fall, intended to prevent the formation of the New-York
  Anti-Slavery Society. And we may fairly attribute to them, more perhaps than
  to any other agents of the pro slavery party, the succession of riots that
  have recently occurred. —The style, in which Messrs. Webb and Stone have
  remarked upon these transactions, (more than half excusing) is adapted,
  if it be not designed, to urge on the populace to further outrage.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp; &nbsp;Now we would ask the intelligent and candid, what does this
  procedure of the pro slavery party prove? What, but that they are conscious
  they cannot meet the opposers of American oppression and cruelty, in fair
  discussion!—If they could disprove our statements, refute our arguments, or
  turn the point of our appeal, are they indeed such men, that they would still,
  of choice, resort to the base means they have been using? We are unwilling to
  think they are so bad. Is it not rather because they foresee that moral means
  can never effect their purposes, that they resort to brute force? We
  think so. Let the intelligent and candid judge.—

"	I've placed this at July 24 issue	The riots in New York City directly affected many of the students at the Canterbury Female Academy. Black communities, Black churches, Black businesses, and white abolitionists were attacked viciously. Numerous ebndorsers of the Canterbury Female Academy were singled out, most notably Peter Williams Jr. and Arthur Tappan. For an interesting discovery about these riots, see <a href="https://blog.mcny.org/2012/04/03/the-abolitionist-riots-of-1834/">this website</a>.

the persons who, on the night of the 9

The Windham County Advertiser	<em>Columbian Register</em> 1834-09-27	Prudence Crandall; Crandall Female Academy; Allied Reform Movements - Anti-Masonry; Abolition; The Unionist; Vigilante Violence	"<em>The Windham County Advertiser,</em>
at Brooklyn, by J. Holbrook, Esq. is ably and judiciously conducted and is doing
much service to the democratic cause in that county and the region round about.
A friend has sent us a number of the Windham County Whig and Unionist, which
notices the late Meeting at Windham in true billingsgate style. This paper was
started as Miss Crandall’s negro vehicle, and was called the Unionist. This
female philanthropist, by her masculine zeal in the negro cause, has finally
obtained the hand of a Mr. Phileo.—Her zeal has now come to a “crisis,” her
house in Canterbury, lately occupied as a “School for colored Misses,” is
offered for sale, and the school is given up, all because the inhabitants stoned
the house in the night season, and endangered the lives of the “teachers and
colored Misses.” We suppose Mr. Calvin Phileo and his wife Prudence will now
retire to some favored retreat, and raise little Phileo’s. But the Unionist
turns Windham County Whig as Mrs. Prudence turns from her school. The Unionist
has also a small touch of the Anti Mason, and is urging the Antis to come into
the support of Trumbull, Jackson &amp; Co. It is curious to see the odd ends of
all parties, disappointed politicians, zealots in negroism, Indianism,
Mormonism, and every other mad project, finally fall in with the federal
party—there to swell occasionally, and fall still lower with the old carcase
[sic], while it is undergoing its long process of decomposition. This Unionist
is the foulest substance we have seen yet among whiggery. The very types
employed by this woebegone editor, like Balaam’s ass, refuse to perform their
ordinary duty.

Carrying the war into Egypt	<em>Providence Patriot</em> 1834-09-27	Prudence Crandall; Crandall Female Academy; Vigilante Violence	"<em>“Carrying the war into Egypt,”</em>
—We had supposed that the crusade which the good people of Canterbury, Ct have
for some time past waged against the school of <em>Miss Crandall,</em> would have been suffered to drop when the whole force of legal proceedings had
been spent upon them, and the lady herself became one of the band of “reputably
married ladies.” But we find by advertisements in the last Brooklyn Unionist,
that her neighbors were not as charitably and forgivingly disposed as ourself.
Mr. Calvin Phileo, the husband of Miss C. advertises in the paper above named,
that during the night of the ninth instant his house was assaulted by a number
of persons armed with heavy clubs and iron bars, who destroyed five window
sashes and about one hundred panes of glass, and the family greatly alarmed,
though it does not appear any of them were injured. Mr. Phileo and lady have
consequently determined to quit that ‘heathenish neighborhood,’ and offer their
house and appurtenances for sale, and a reward of fifty dollars for such
information as may lead to the detection of their assailants. The reputation of
the city of Canterbury will (if it has not already) suffer more in the
estimation of the dispassionate and unprejudiced in all parts of the Union, than
have the parties and principles against whom they have kept up such an
exterminating war, if the institution is not allowed to be dissolved without
further violence, and its inmates permitted to ‘depart in peace.’” "	This article was copied from a New York paper, here abbreviated to <em>NY Man.</em>	This article was copied from a New York paper, here abbreviated to <em>NY Man.</em>	Prudence Crandall; Calvin Philleo

Third Trial	<em>The Liberator</em> 1834-09-27; 1834-10-11		The transcripts of the Third Trial of Crandall under Connecticut's Black Law, held in the Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors in July of 1833, was published in pamphlet form by <em>The Liberator</em>, after that newspaper had published it in the issues of September 27 and October 11, 1834. As these transcripts are widely available, and nowhere mention <em>The Unionist</em> or the Burleighs by name, I have not transcribed them here. The full pamphlet is available <a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/rbcmisc.lst0089/?sp=1&st=text">from the Library of Congress</a>.		It would make sense that the Unionist would have published this trial; there certainly was time in the span between the trial and the attack on the school. But until full evidence is recovered, this is speculative.
Welcome to the Unionist	<em>Genius of Temperance, Philanthropist and People’s Advocate</em> 1833-08-07, v. 4, n.5		"A new paper called “The Unionist” has commenced at Brooklyn. Con. by Charles C. Burleigh, Esq., a gentleman of learning and talents. It is “pledged to no party” but promises to advocate “temperance, virtue, and sound morality.” We are pleased to add, for the credit of Windham County, (in which, by the bye, the writer of this paragraph spent several of his earlier years) that the disgraceful proceedings at Canterbury and the mockery of law enacted to shield and sustain them, are treated according to their merits, in the columns of the Unionist. We wish it success. And may the Putnams of that region ever be shrewd in tracing public pests to their dark retreats, and bold in dragging them forth to the day light, regardless of their fiery eyes, and their growling.
A liberal support to the Unionist would do much towards retrieving the character of Connecticut from the disgrace cast upon it, by A.T. Judson, and his associates.

<p align=""center"">PROSPECTUS</p> <p align=""center"">OF</p> <p align=""center""><strong>THE UNIONIST.</strong></p> <p>At no time more than at the present, has been felt the want, in this county, of a firm, independent press. The acts of our last legislature are a sufficient index of the character of that party which has obtained, for a brief space we hope, the ascendancy in this State. We cannot, for a moment, believe that a majority of the people of Connecticut, approve <em>all</em> the recent enactments of our Legislature, but such has been and is still the course pursued by the only press existing in this county, that many of the people are probably unapprised of the spirit and tendency of their proceedings. It is too evident to be denied, that the Advertiser is so devoted to the policy of a party, and the aggrandizement of a few party leaders, that a fair discussion of the pretensions and measures of our prominent men, cannot find admission to its columns. Hence the necessity of another organ of communication to the public, on the great interests of the state and nation, which has brought the Unionist before the public.</p> <p>This paper will be pledged to no party, but will canvass the claims of all aspirants to the public favor, and all measures of public policy, on their own merits.

Countering a False Report of the School's Closure	<em>Genius of Temperance, Philanthropist and People’s Advocate</em> 1833-10-16, v. 4, n.15	Prudence Crandall; Canterbury Female Academy; The Unionist	The N.Y. Daily Advertiser quotes the Traveller [sic] as saying, on authority of a gentleman from Connecticut, that Miss Crandall had dismissed her school, in consequence of the late decision of Judge Daggett. The Brooklyn Unionist of the 10th inst., contains no intimation of that character, and we presume it to be a mistake. Indeed we know, that the School has been visited since the decision, and every thing found going on as usual. Several scholars are about to be added to it.		Here William Goodell states that he trusts <em>The Unionist</em> over a major New York City paper. This is of course, somewhat partisan in nature, but it is also, in this case, accurate. The school did not close after Daggett's ruling, but instead flourished for almost another year.	Prudence Crandall; David Daggett
Concerning the legal arguments of William Jay	<em>Genius of Temperance, Philanthropist and People’s Advocate</em> 1833-10-16, v. 4, n.15	Prudence Crandall; Black Law; Canterbury Female Academy	The Unionist contains a letter of Rev. S.J. May, enclosing a communication from Hon. Wm. Jay, of Bedford forwarding some documents, which, had they arrived sooner, would have been presented at the trial of Miss Crandall.—The decision of Judge Daggett, it will be borne in mind, was made on the ground that free colored persons are not citizens. In opposition to this doctrine, Judge Jay quotes, from the Reports of proceedings and debates of the Convention of 1821, for amending the Constitution of N. York, extracts of Speeches of Peter A. Jay, R. Clark Chancellor Kent, and Rufus King, in which the contrary doctrine is maintained.—A letter of Dewitt Clinton, Governor of N. York, to President Adams, in 1826, is also given, in which the Governor demands of the President, the release of Gilbert Horton, a colored <em>citizen</em> of this State, unlawfully imprisoned in the District of Columbia.		William Goodell confirms that Jay's legal opinions could have made a difference at the second trial.

Confirming Growth and Harassment of School	<em>Genius of Temperance, Philanthropist and People’s Advocate</em> 1833-10-30, v. 4, n.17	Prudence Crandall; Canterbury Female Academy; Vigilante Violence	"MISS CRANDALL’S SCHOOL.
The Brooklyn, Con., Unionist, as we had anticipated, confirms the fact that Miss Crandall’s School at Canterbury, instead of being closed, is increasing. Unless put down by mob law, there is no way in which the school is likely to be suppressed, previous to the sitting of the Supreme Court of Errors, next July.
The last Emancipator mentions that a minister of the gospel has recently been refused the privilege of preaching in the meeting house, on Canterbury green, because he had visited Miss Crandall’s School. The same account mentions that a physician, having been called to one of the pupils, in a case of emergency, gave notion that, in obedience to public sentiment, he should be obliged to decline any future call of the kind. We are inclined to think this latter item an accidental repetition of a circumstance, which, we believe, occurred some time past. We forget whether, or no, our readers were informed of it; or of the kindred circumstance that a poor washer-woman, though desirous of washing clothes for Miss Crandall’s family, was obliged to yield to the public sentiment of the village, which was outraged at so enormous a crime. As to pulling down the house, though we doubt not the existence of sufficient malice and tyranny on the part of a <em>few</em>, to be <em>gratified</em> with almost any outrage, we have no idea that any thing of the kind will be seriously attempted. Miss Crandall is gaining too many friends, and her persecutors incurring too much odium, even in that region, to admit the supposition.

December 1833 Arrest of Prudence and Almira Crandall	<em>Genius of Temperance, Philanthropist and People’s Advocate</em> 1833-12-19, v. 4, n.24	Black Law; Prudence Crandall; Canterbury Female Academy	ANOTHER PROSECUTION.—Miss Crandall and her sister were on Saturday last brought before Justice Adams, charged with the old offence of teaching “the base born Africans, unmindful of the highest behest which says, ‘let there be darkness.’” They were found guilty and required to procure bonds for their appearance at the County Court, now in session. No one appearing immediately to give the required bonds, the Court was adjourned until Monday, that they might have time to procure them. We cannot account for this wonderful forbearance on the part of the <em>honorable</em> prosecutors, unless we believe they fear a second imprisonment would bring upon their heads the indignation of the public, as it most certainly would. Whether this dismission of the prisoners was legal or not, we pretend not to decide. But what was the necessity of again arresting Miss C.? The case has been appealed to a higher tribunal, why bring it again to the County Court: Why this persecuting continually with vexatious suits, from which no good can result? Is it done for the purpose of extorting money from her? We only ask for information.—<em>Brooklyn Ct. Unionist</em>		This is the full version of the oft-reprinted story of the arrest of Prudence and Almira Crandall in early December 1833.

Human endurance has its bounds, and the requirements of duty have theirs. By the following Advertisements, which we copy from the Brooklyn Unionist, it appears that another cowardly attack has been made upon Miss Crandall’s (now Mrs. Phileo’s) dwelling, by some midnight ruffians in Canterbury, and that it has been deemed advisable to abandon the school in that heathenish village, and to let ANDREW T. JUDSON and his associates, with the whole State of Connecticut, have all the infamy and guilt which attach to the violent suppression of so praiseworthy an institution. <em>O, tempora! O, mores!</em> $50 REWARD!!—During the night of Tuesday the 9th inst. about 12 o’clock, the house of the subscriber in Canterbury was assaulted by a number of lawless persons with heavy clubs or iron bars; five window sashes were destroyed, and more than ninety panes of glass were dashed to pieces, and the family greatly alarmed. The above named reward is hereby offered to any one, who will give information that will lead to the detection of the perpetrators of the outrage, or any one of them. CALVIN PHILLEO. Canterbury, Sept. 11, 1834 ---- FOR SALE. The house in Canterbury occupied by the late Prudence Crandall, now the wife of the subscriber. The impunity with which repeated assaults have been made upon these premises, has awakened the apprehension that the property, and perhaps the lives of those connected with the school, are insecure. I have therefore thought it proper, and do hereby advertise the house and appurtenances thereof for sale. For further particulars inquire of the subscriber, or of PARDON CRANDALL, of Canterbury, or SAMUEL J. MAY of Brooklyn. CALVIN PHILEO. Canterbury, Sept. 11, 1834
☞ From a letter which we have just received from our esteemed coadjutor, Rev. SAMUEL J. MAY, we make the following extract, relating to the above shameful outrage:
        ‘You will be grieved to learn from the advertisements, that Mrs. Phileo’s house had been again assaulted. On Tuesday night, 12 o’clock, five windows were smashed in at once. I went down yesterday, so soon as I heard of it. They have never been so much disconcerted before. Their two front rooms are hardly tenantable, and yet they are unwilling to repair the damage, not knowing but the destroyers may come upon them again, so soon as they are whole, and repeat the outrage. As yet, their neighbors have done nothing, nor have they shown any disposition to do any thing to protect them from outrage. The pupils are very much intimidated, and the instructors themselves have hardly resolution to go on in opposition to such lawless neighbors. After due consideration, therefore, it was yesterday determined that the school should be suspended. The pupils accordingly will go to their homes as soon as convenient. I was requested to go in to the School, and announce to them our decision—and I have never before felt so sensible of the uncalled for, cruel persecution which has been carried on in this New-England village against a family of defenceless females. Twenty harmless girls, whose only offence against the peace of the community is that they have come together there to obtain useful knowledge, were to be told that they had better go away, because forsooth the house in which they dwell is not protected by the conservators of the peace, the officers of justice, in the community in which it is situated. The words almost blistered my lips. My heart glowed with indignation. I felt ashamed of Canterbury, ashamed of Connecticut, ashamed of my Country.’

She will not abandon the prosecution of her benevolent plan, till it is fully settled by the competent tribunal that the law against it is constitutuonal. Should the event ever take place, as we trust it will not, she will then doubtless, like a good citizen submit to the law, however unjust and oppressive, till the people redeem the statue book from its disgrace.--<em>Brooklyn (Con.)
